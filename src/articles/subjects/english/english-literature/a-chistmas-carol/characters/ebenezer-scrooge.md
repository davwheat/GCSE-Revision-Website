# Scrooge doesn't seem to care about anything except money

- At the start of the novella Scrooge is portrayed very negatively, as someone who only cares about money - he's described as "_a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!_"
- He's so miserly and mean that he begrudges Bob Cratchit his Christmas wages, and won't allow him a decent fire.
- In a vision of Scrooge's past, his fianc√©e, Belle, says that Scrooge sees money as an "_Idol_", and that it has "_displaced_" her in Scrooge's affections. This suggests that Scrooge worships money as if it's a god, and his love for it is greater than his love for Belle.
- At the start he is:

  - bitter: "_No wind that blew was bitterer than he_"
  - cynical: "_What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money_"
  - isolated: "_secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster_"

# He's cold-hearted and unfeeling

- Scrooge is unsympathetic towards other people, so he has no interest in helping the poor. He refuses to donate to charity - he thinks he's done enough by paying taxes to support the prisons and workhouses.
- He's indifferent to how poor people might feel, and he believes it's not his "_business_" to care about them.
- Dickens describes Scrooge using cold and icy language - there's a "_cold within him_" that "_froze his old features_", and he's described as having a "_frosty rime_". This association with the cold emphasises Scrooge's cold-hearted nature.

# We learn that Scrooge's past has shaped him

- As the reader sees more of Scrooge's past, it becomes easier to understand why Scrooge is so cold and bitter - the events of his past are partly responsible for his present-day personality.
- Scrooge is shown sympathetically as "_a lonely boy_" near a "_feeble fire_" at his old school. We learn that he's been left there because his father won't let him come home for Christmas.
- Scrooge is eventually brought home by his sister, who he clearly had a close relationship with. It's possible that he isolates himself from Fred because he's a sad reminder of the sister Scrooge has lost.
- Scrooge is distressed at the vision of Belle leaving him, and this painful memory is made worse by the vision of Belle's happy family. The reader feels sympathy when he pleads "_in a broken voice_" to be shown no more. It seems like the heartbreak Scrooge suffered may have contributed to his bitter closed-off personality in Stave One.

# Scrooge has to see himself as others see him

- Throughout the visions, Scrooge is forced to see how other people talk about him when he's not around:
  - Mrs Cratchit calls Scrooge an "_odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man_"
  - Fred says he's "_a comical old fellow_", and "_not so pleasant as he might be_"
  - A businessman calls Scrooge "_Old Scratch_" - a nickname for the devil
  - A couple, who owe Scrooge call him "_merciless_"
- At the beginning of the novella, Scrooge is selfish - he doesn't care about how his attitude to life affects others. However, the spirits show him the way other people talk about him, which makes him realise his faults and convinces him to change his attitude.

# Tiny Tim shows Scrooge that poor people are people too

- Seeing Tiny Tim helps Scrooge to feel empathy again. Scrooge asks the spirit if Tim will die, with "_an interest he has never felt before_" - Tim's situation makes Scrooge start to care about other people.
- The Ghost of Christmas Present uses Tim to show Scrooge how wrong his beliefs about "_surplus population_" are, and to force him to think about poor people as individuals. Scrooge is saddened by how cruel his opinions were.
- Scrooge is "_overcome with penitence and grief_" when he realises how wrong he's been. He starts to accept that helping poor people like Tim, is his responsibility.

# Scrooge's values change

- Scrooge's character changes completely by the end of the novel. He laughs at himself and says he's "_as merry as a school-boy_"
- He also learns to be charitable. He buys the Cratchits a Christmas turkey and makes a large donation to charity.
- Scrooge completely changes his mind about Christmas - the narrator says that he "_knew how to keep Christmas well_".
- The spirits teach Scrooge how to value family and companionship, so he embraces his nephew's family and becomes a father figure to Tiny Tim.
- Scrooge becomes:
  - generous: "_I'll raise your salary_"
  - happy: "_Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile_"
  - sociable: "_Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity_"
