# Marley's ghost has come to warn Scrooge

- Marley's main role in the novel is to warn Scrooge about what will happen after he dies - unless he changes.
- Marley and Scrooge have similar personalities - they're "_two kindred spirits_", who are obsessed with money and don't care about other people. They are so similar that Scrooge lives in Marley's old rooms and even answers to Marley's name - "_it was all the same to him_". These similarities emphasise Marley's role as a warning figure.
- Marley's punishment is the consequence of a self-centred, "_misused_" life. Dickens has already shown Scrooge behaving similarly - so Marley's fate illustrates what will happen to Scrooge if he doesn't change.

# Marley's appearance is disturbing

- Scrooge feels "_the chilling influence_" of Marley's "_death-cold eyes_" and when the ghost removes the bandage from its head, its "_lower jaw dropped down upon its breast_" - a horrible image. Marley's terrifying appearance reflects the frightening nature of his message and it makes it seem more important.
- Marley gives off an "_infernal_" (hellish) atmosphere, and his clothes are "_agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven_". This description links Marley to ideas of hell and eternal suffering.
- The chain Marley wears is made of money-related objects. It was forged because he cared more about money than people. The chain is particularly disturbing for Scrooge because Marley tells him that he bears a similar chain, but much larger.
- Marley is:
  - terrifying: "_the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones_"
  - exhausted: "_I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere_"
  - direct: "_I am here tonight to warn you_"

# Marley tries to help Scrooge

- Marley regrets that he didn't change his ways whilst he was alive - it's too late for him to avoid suffering. All he can do is offer Scrooge the chance to escape the same fate.
- He has stood invisibly at Scrooge's shoulder for "_many a day_" in the past. He acts as a kind of hellish guardian angel.
- Marley says that his presence now is "_a chance and hope_" of his own "_procuring_". This suggests that he's tried (and succeeded) to find a way to help Scrooge and give him a chance to save himself.
- Marley is acting selflessly - he's helping a friend, even though he has no hope of redemption himself.
