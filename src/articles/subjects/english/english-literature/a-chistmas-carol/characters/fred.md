# Fred is a complete contrast to Scrooge

- Fred arrives in Scrooge's offices "_all in a glow_" and "_his eyes sparkled_" - this emphasises the warmth and friendliness of his character. He's the opposite of Scrooge, who is associated with the cold and dark.
- Fred disagrees with Scrooge's miserly values. He thinks that Scrooge's wealth is useless because "_he don't do any good with it_" - suggesting that, unlike Scrooge, he values happiness more than money.
- He's empathetic - he's "_heartily sorry_" for the Cratchit family after Tim dies, even though he barely knows them. This contrasts with Scrooge who begins the novella as a self-centred person who doesn't care about others.
- Dickens uses Fred as a foil to Scrooge's character. The differences between them emphasise Scrooge's negative qualities.

# Fred is a cheerful man

- Fred's personality is defined by his distinctive and pleasant laugh. The narrator says he'd like to meet "_a man more blessed in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew_". Fred illustrates his cheerfulness and optimism.
- He's even-tempered and refuses to argue with Scrooge. He tells Scrooge "_I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last_" and later says that he "_couldn't be angry_" with Scrooge even if he tried.
- Fred shows insight when he says that Scrooge's "_offences carry their own punishment_" - he understands that by refusing to embrace his family, Scrooge is only hurting himself.
- He's determined to include Scrooge in the celebrations: "_I mean to give him the same chance, every year, whether he likes it or not_". He believes in the importance of being kind at Christmas, especially to family.

# Fred shows true Christmas spirit

- Dickens presents Fred as someone who shows lots of the values associated with Christmas and the Christmas spirit.
- Fred shows generosity to Scrooge in inviting him to his party, and forgiveness when he welcomes Scrooge into his home, despite Scrooge's behaviour - "_It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off_"
- Fred also knows how to have fun - his Christmas party is an enjoyable occasion, which is filled with games and laughter.
- Fred is:
  - jovial: "_Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh_"
  - enthusiastic: "_A merry Christmas uncle! God save you!_"
  - caring: "_Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr Scrooge's nephew_"
