# At first, Scrooge only cares about himself and money

- Scrooge is apathetic about the plight of the poor. He believes that his taxes pay for the prisons and workhouses, so he doesn't feel the needs to donate anything to charity. He suggests that if they would rather die, "_they had better do it_", and "_decrease the surplus population_".
- Scrooge's views lead him to exploit people like Bob Cratchit. He makes Bob work for low pay and in freezing conditions.
- Belle explains that Scrooge lives in fear of poverty. He has become engrossed by "_the master-passion, Gain_" in the hope of being beyond the "_sordid reproach_" of poverty. Scrooge even remarks of the world, "_there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty_".
- By revealing Scrooge's fear of poverty, Dickens makes Scrooge's attitude to the poor in Stave One seem even worse. Scrooge knows that poverty is awful, but his fear has made him selfish towards those in need.

# Dickens exposes the unfair treatment of the poor

- Dickens says that some of the chained phantoms in Stave One might be "_guilty governments_". This could be seen as a criticism by Dickens of the government's treatments of the poor. The chains these ghosts wear are the same as Marley's - they're the result of an uncaring attitude towards the poor.
- Dickens uses the Ghost of Christmas Present to condemn the "_bigotry, and selfishness_" of those who supported Sabbatarianism. Dickens attacks Sabbatarianism because of the restrictions it places on the poor.
- The Ghost of Christmas Present also reveals Ignorance and Want - children who are described as "_horrible_" monsters. The spirit suggests that these hidden problems are a product of society's neglect of the poor.

# The wealthy must take responsibility for the poor

- The Ghost of Christmas Present gives a clear warning - he says that ignorance will lead to the "_Doom_" of society. Dickens is pointing out that to avoid this, society must address the lack of education received by the poor.
- The fate of Tiny Tim makes a clear link between poverty and death - it's only Scrooge's intervention that saves him. Dickens is clearly showing that the wealthy have a responsibility to help the poor because they can make a big difference to their lives.
- Dickens' message can also be found in the words of Marley when he explains to Scrooge that he must take responsibility for those around him - his true "_business_" is the "_common welfare_" of mankind. It's this lesson - of "_charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence_" - that Scrooge eventually learns.

# The Cratchits show what living in poverty can be like

- Dickens uses the Cratchits as an example of people living in poverty
- The Cratchits live in a four-room house. Their clothes are threadbare, but they make an effort - Belinda and Mrs Cratchit are "_brave in ribbons_" and Peter feels "_gallantly attired_" in his handed-down "_shirt collar_".
- The Cratchits' Christmas dinner has to be "_Eked out_", and their Christmas pudding is "_small_" for such a large family. Their modest Christmas dinner suggests that they don't have much to eat for the rest of the year.
- The Ghost of Christmas Presents hints that "_if these shadows remain unaltered_" - if the Cratchits continue to live in poverty - then Tiny Tim will die. It's only because of Scrooge intervenes that Tim survives.

# There are also glimpses of the seedier side of poverty

- Joe's shop - where Scrooge's stolen possessions are sold in Stave Four - is in a filthy part of the city where the streets are "_foul and narrow_" and the alleys "_like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt_".
- The people who live there are "_half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly_"
- Three thieves gather there to sell the property they've stolen from Scrooge's corpse. They're not embarrassed or remorseful, and they laugh as they go through the stolen goods.

# Dickens goes beyond the simple definitions of rich and poor

- Dickens shows that while people can be rich financially, they can also be rich in other ways, such as enjoyment, love and companionship.
- The Cratchits are poor but they appreciate what they have. They're portrayed as an unrealistically perfect family who don't need money to make them emotionally rich. By contrast, Scrooge is financially wealthy, but he's poor in companionship and enjoyment. Fred explains that, even though Scrooge is rich, he's deserving of pity because "_His wealth is of no use to him_".
- Fred emphasises the value of emotion richness to him when he says that although Christmas never put "_a scrap of gold or silver_" in his pocket, it's made him richer in spirit and "_done me good_".
- Fezziwig is a successful businessman, but he's also rich emotionally. He uses some of his wealth to bring happiness and joy to himself and those around him.
