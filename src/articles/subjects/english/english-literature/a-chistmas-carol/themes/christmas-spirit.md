# Christmas brings out the best in people

- Throughout A Christmas Carol, Christmas is presented as a time when people "_open their shut-up hearts freely_". Several characters in the novel demonstrate this Christmas spirit - they show generosity, charity, kindness and goodwill to others.
- The Cratchits' Christmas celebration demonstrates their love for each other and their happiness at being together. For example Bob, is disappointed when his wife tells him that Martha isn't coming home for Christmas Day, and he's relieved when she appears from her hiding place. It's very important to Bob that the whole family is together for Christmas.
- Fred fully embraces the spirit of Christmas. He refers to Christmas as a "_kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time_" that brings out the best in people, and he hopes that Scrooge will embrace Christmas too.

# The Christmas spirit involves generosity and kindness

Many of the characters see it as a time to help the less fortunate

- The charity collectors that visit Scrooge are a good example of this. They refer to Christmas as a time when "_Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices_". They're trying to provide some festive "_Christian cheer_" at a time when poverty is made most obvious by the excesses enjoyed by the wealthy.
- Similarly, Fred believes that Christmas should encourage people "_to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave_". He thinks that Christmas is a time when all of humanity, rich and poor, should unite and help each other, rather than carrying on with their business as isolated individuals.
- Fezziwig also demonstrates generosity and kindness of spirit. He has the power to render his apprentices "_happy or unhappy_", to make their work "_light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil_" and chooses to behave in a way that can only bring happiness. He throws a wonderful Christmas party for his employees and exhibits a contagious joy throughout.
  -By contrast, Scrooge sees Christmas purely in monetary terms. He questions how Fred can be merry at Christmas when he is "_poor enough_" - this shows he links happiness with money, even thought it doesn't bring him joy. Fred highlights this when he says "_His wealth is of no use to him_".

# The Christmas spirit has both a religious and secular side

- A lot of what Dickens says about the Christmas spirit is related to his view of Christianity. For example, the values that Fred associates with Christmas (kindness, forgiveness and charity) are exactly the kinds of "_Christian cheer_" that Dickens associated with Christianity - he thought helping others should be an important part of people's faith.
- However, for Dickens, Christmas also had a secular element - there's plenty of evidence of a non-religious celebration of Christmas. As Fred says, Christmas is "_a good time_", even "_apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin_".
- A good example of the more secular celebration of Christmas is the childish excitement that surrounds it - particularly at Fred's house, where the family roar with laughter amidst the music and games, and at Fezziwig's party. There are similar scenes at the Cratchits' home, where the family delight in their small feast and shared companionship.
- Dickens links this giddy, childish behaviour back to the religious side of Christmas by saying it's "_good to be children sometimes_", especially at Christmas when "_its mighty Founder was a child himself_".

# The Christmas spirit is powerful enough to transform Scrooge

- At first, Scrooge's reaction to Christmas is "_Humbug_", and he thinks that anyone who celebrates Christmas is an "_idiot_".
- Scrooge's attitude is ridiculed at Fred's party, and he's the only source of anger during the Cratchits' celebrations - he's referred to as the "Ogre of the family" and his name casts "_a dark shadow_" on the party.
- By the end of the story, Scrooge is transformed by what he's learned about the Christmas spirit. He wishes everyone he meets a "_merry Christmas_", he makes a large donation to charity, he buys a huge turkey for the Cratchits, and he even attends his nephew's Christmas party.
- Scrooge promises to "_honour Christmas_" in his heart and to "_try to keep it all the year_".
