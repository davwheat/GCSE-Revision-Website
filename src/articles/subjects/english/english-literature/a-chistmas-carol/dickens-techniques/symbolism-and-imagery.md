# Dickens uses symbols to develop his ideas

- Marley's chain was forged "_link by link_" from his "_own free will_". The fact that it's made out of '_cash-boxes_', '_keys_', '_padlocks_' and '_ledgers_' symbolises Marley's obsession with money and how that led him to selfishly ignore his "_fellowmen_".
- The children, Ignorance and Want, are clear symbols in the novel. They personify the problems caused by society's neglect of the poor.
- There are many symbols associated with the ghosts, for example:
  - The "_bright, clear jet of light_" that shines from the Ghost of Christmas Past's head could symbolise the truth that can be found in memories.
  - The Ghost of Christmas Present's torch, which it uses to spread good will, is a symbol of the transforming power of Christmas. He also wears a rusty scabbard without a sword, which is a symbol of peace.
  - The dark shroud worn by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come almost entirely covers it. symbolising that Scrooge's future is ominous and uncertain.

# Warmth and brightness symbolise joy and companionship

- Throughout A Christmas Carol, images of fire and brightness are used as symbols of emotional warmth.
- Several of these images of fire and brightness are shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Present. It shows miners "_assembled round a glowing fire_" and the lighthouse men's fire that throws out a "_ray of brightness on the awful sea_". All of these images use fire as a symbol of comfort and celebration.
- This idea is developed further when Scrooge and the spirit travel along the streets, they see the "_brightness of the roaring fires_" lighting up kitchens and parlours, and the "_flickering of the blaze_" that reveals preparations for "_cosy_" dinners. All these joyful scenes take place in the glow of fires.
- In contrast, Scrooge keeps his rooms dark because "_darkness is cheap_". He has "_a very small fire_" in his offices and "_a very low fire_" at home. The lack of warmth and light in Scrooge's life symbolises his lack of joy and companionship.
  At the end, Scrooge tells Bob to "_make up the fires_". This is symbolic of Scrooge's transformation, and ie fact that he has learnt to understand the importance of showing kindness and generosity to others.

# Music is an important symbol of celebration and happiness

- Music is central to the Christmas celebrations at Fezziwig's party and at Fred's house, and Dickens also mentions the singing of Tiny Tim, the miners and the lighthouse men.
- There's a strong contrast between the joy and happiness of Fred's "_musical family_" and the lonely, miserable Scrooge, whose life is without music (this is emphasised when Scrooge scares away the carol singer in Chapter One).
- Music is also shown to have a powerful emotional effect. When Scrooge hears some music performed by his niece (Fred's wife), he wonders whether if he'd been able to listen to it more, "_he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands_". Dickens is arguing that music is so powerful in creating happiness that it could've transformed Scrooge's life.

# Scrooge's bed is a motif

- The first ghost's visit begins at Scrooge's bed, and after the last ghost's visit, he's returned to his bed — when the Ghost of Christmas Past appears it draws back the curtains of Scrooge's bed, whilst the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come dwindles "_down into a bedpost_".
- A person's bed is a private place, so it's important that the ghosts' visits begin and end at Scrooge's bed — they want to access his most private thoughts and emotions. The bed is also a place that is associated with sleeping and dreaming — this emphasises the dreamlike, unreal quality of the visions shown to Scrooge, making it easier for the reader to suspend their disbelief.

# Weather reflects Scrooge's character and emotions

- Throughout the first chapter, Dickens emphasises the fog and cold that surrounds Scrooge. The fog is shown "_pouring in at every chink and keyhole_", whilst the weather is described as "_cold, bleak, biting_". The weather is symbolic of Scrooge's cold-hearted isolation.
- Scrooge is described as carrying "_cold within him_", and his presence "_iced his office_". Scrooge's cold and bitter personalty is presented as being more powerful than the weather — the narrator explains "_No warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he_".
- In the final chapter, the weather becomes a symbol of Scrooge's transformation. The fog has gone, symbolising how Scrooge has had his eyes opened and can clearly see those around him. The weather is "_clear, bright, jovial, stirring_", and the cold is "_piping for the blood to dance to_", which represents Scrooge's new brightness and enthusiasm for life.
