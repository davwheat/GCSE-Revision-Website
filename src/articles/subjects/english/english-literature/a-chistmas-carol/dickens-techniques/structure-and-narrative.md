# The novel has a simple structure

- A Christmas Carol is divided into five chapters, and Dickens called each chapter a 'stave'. Staves are the five lines on which musical notes are written, which may explain why there are five chapters. The word 'stave' is also another word for a verse of a song.
- The use of staves and the title, A Christmas Carol, suggest that this novel, like a carol, was meant to be listened to and enjoyed by groups of people. Reading aloud to friends and family was more common in Victorian times than it is today.
- Each chapter of the novel has a clear and separate purpose:
  - The first chapter introduces Scrooge and emphasises his character flaws, before setting into motion the events that will lead to his redemption.
  - The middle three chapters each relate to Scrooge's past, present and future, and they contain various lessons for Scrooge to learn from the three ghosts. The appearance of each ghost is signalled by the ominous tolling of a bell.
  - The final chapter reintroduces things from the first chapter, such as the charity collectors. This gives the story a circular structure that clearly shows how Scrooge has changed — Scrooge shows that he's learned from his experience, saying that he promises to "_live in the Past, the Present and the Future_".
- Dickens includes several hints that the story will have a happy ending:
  - Scrooge's transformation is foreshadowed by the change in Scrooge's father. The fact that Scrooge was more kind-hearted in his youth also acts as a hint that he will be able to change back.
  - In the first few pages of the novel, Dickens uses the phrase "_Once upon a time_", which links the story to a fairy tale and suggests that it will have a happy ending.

# The story has an unusual time scheme

- The story doesn't follow a chronological structure. It's mainly set in Scrooge's present, but it includes three separate episodes that have visions set in different time periods — Scrooge's past, present and future.
- Each individual episode with the ghosts doesn't follow a regular time scheme — each one contains several jumps in time.
- The linking sections between each ghostly visit are set in Scrooge's present, but they also don't follow the normal rules of time. Scrooge falls asleep after 2 am, but he's visited by the first ghost at 1 am that same night. The tolling of the bell shows that hours are passing, but the three visits only take one night.

# Supernatural visits drive the action

- The reader is repeatedly made aware that the ghosts have a short amount of time convey their messages to Scrooge. This drives the plot forward and messages dramatic tension that builds with each ghostly visit.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past instructs Scrooge to "_Rise! and walk with me!_", and its manner gets more urgent from then on. It tells Scrooge "_Let us go on_", "_Let us see another Christmas!_" and, "_My time grows short... Quick!_"
- The Ghost of Christmas Present's visit is a blur of activity. Scrooge and the spirit speed through several Christmas visions, but there's a sense that there's barely enough time for Scrooge to learn all that he needs to learn before the spirit leaves — the spirit warns Scrooge "_My life upon this globe, is very brief_".
- The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is in such a hurry it appears in the chapter of the previous ghost. It rushes Scrooge towards what seems to be his final lesson — the vision of Scrooge's own corpse. Scrooge slows down the pace by refusing to look at the corpse, which increases the tension as the reader worries that Scrooge may run out of time to fully learn his lesson. However, later on, the pace builds as the spirit relentlessly points Scrooge towards his final lesson in the graveyard.

# The omniscient narrator influences the reader's view of Scrooge

- The narrator puts the reader at ease immediately with his casual tone and humorous ramblings about the phrase "_dead as a doornail_". The narrator comes across as a talkative, witty storyteller — Dickens presents the narrator in this way so that the reader likes and trusts him.
- Once the narrator has the reader's trust, he gives lots of negative opinions about Scrooge, e.g. describing him as a "_covetous old sinner_" with "_ferret eyes_". By doing this, Dickens uses the narrator to encourage the reader to despise Scrooge at first.
- As the novel goes on and Scrooge begins to change, the narrator reveals the feelings and emotions Scrooge is experiencing, causing the reader to sympathise with Scrooge. This allows the narrator to drastically change. the reader's opinion of Scrooge over the course of the text, making his eventual transformation even more powerful.
  - The narrator also shares some of his own feelings and emotions with the reader. For example, he shows a mischievous side to his nature when he talks about Belle's daughter being harassed by her siblings — "_What would I not have given to be one of them!_" Dickens gives the narrator a light-hearted personality to make him more engaging for the reader.
