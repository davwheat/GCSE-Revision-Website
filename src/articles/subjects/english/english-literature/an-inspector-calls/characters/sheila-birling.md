Sheila's not heard the old saying 'start as you mean to go on'. At the beginning of the play she seems childish and petty, but later reveals herself as thoughtful, sensitive and sharp. By the end, Sheila wants to start her life again.

# She seems to be different to the rest of the family

- Sheila's quick-witted and strong-minded. She hands Gerald's ring back when she finds out he's been unfaithful and is wise enough to suspect that Eric might be the father of Eva/Daisy's child.
- However, Sheila was more selfish the year before. She abused her status as a wealthy customer at Milwards when she insisted they dismiss Eva/Dais.

# Her language makes her seem childish at first

- The stage directions say she's "_very pleased with life and rather excited_".
- She uses slang expressions like "_squiffy_" which remind the audience that Sheila belongs to a younger generation.
- When she gets the ring she's very excited, and looks to her mother for a royal when she says "_Look mummy isn't it a beauty?_".
- She jokes with Gerald, but the stage directions say that she's "_half serious, half playful_". Her childishness might be a way to hide "_serious_" concerns about her relationship with Gerald.

# She's more mature than the audience first think

## Sheila behaves childishly at the beginning, but what she learns over the evening makes her feel she has to be herself and break away from her parents.

- She has wise instincts — she sees what the Inspector is doing, and knew Gerald's absence was suspicious.
- She's not naive, she knows men prostitutes and knows about dirt old men like Alderman Meggarty.
- As the Inspector says, she "_isn't living on the moon_", and as she says to her father "_I'm not a child_".

# Sheila has moral standards

- Sheila acknowledges she used her "_power_" to "_punish_" Eva Smith, but she regrets her actions and is eager to learn from the consequences.
- Priestley uses her as a moral judge at the end of the play — she says "_probably between us we killed her._" The others don't get as far as admitting that.
- She tells Gerald she respects him more for being "_honest_". She also knows the family must stop these "_silly pretences_". Priestley uses Sheila to show there's hope for change in the new generation.

# The Inspector's revelations change her for good

- Before Gerald leaves, she hands back the engagement ring, saying that they are changed people, "_You and I aren't the same people who sat down to dinner here._"
- After the Inspector goes, her parents want everything to return to the way it was. Sheila, along with Eric, are the only ones who see that they all have to change.
- Out of all the characters in the play Sheila's the one who changes the most.

# Sheila becomes a bit like the Inspector herself

## It's not surprising that Sheila takes the Inspector's side in a lot of this, and even seems to help the Inspector's investigations. They're both after the truth. She adopts some of the Inspector's techniques:

- She asks Gerald as many questions as the Inspector does.
- She reveals Eric's drinking problem to her mother.
- She contradicts and undermines her parents, like the Inspector does. When she's giving the ring back to Gerald she tells her father, "_Don't interfere_".
- She shocks Eric by telling him that his mother refused to help Eva/Daisy. he inspector moves the discussion on quickly by suddenly startling the listeners, and Sheila does the same.

## Sheila sees that the Inspector attacks the others' confidence by asking questions. He does this to break down the wall which they've put between themselves and the girl, Sheila wants to do the same.
