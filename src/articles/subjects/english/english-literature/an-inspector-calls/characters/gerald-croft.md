Gerald's the son-in-law Mr Birling dreamt of. He's the son of the competition, Croft Limited. His mother's a Lady. He's respectable. So, apart from the secret mistress, he's spot on.

# Gerald Croft is an eligible bachelor

- At the start, Gerald seems like a good catch. He gets on well with Mr Birling and impresses Mrs Birling.
- But then it turns out Gerald's been lying — he confesses that he had a fling with Daisy Renton last summer. Sheila hands his engagement ring back.
- Gerald leads the Birlings to realise that Inspector Goole was not a police officer, and that there was suicide recorded at the hospital. He sides with Mr Birling, focusing on how to protect their reputation

# Gerald's got a rosy future ahead of him...

## Gerald's got a lot going for him. He's handsome, wealthy, about thirty — a respectable man-about-town.

- He's from an old county family — unlike the Birlings. That makes him their social superior.
- Gerald works for "_Crofts Limited_". This is his father's firm, and is older and bigger than "_Birling and Company_" - the two companies are "_friendly rivals_". He'll probably take it over when his father retires.
- He's relaxed and comfortable in this company (unlike Eric), and shares jokes with Biding.

# But it's a future that looks an awful lot like Birling 's

## Gerald's like a younger version of Arthur Birling. He's used to and comfortable with being in control.

- Gerald agrees with Birling on politics and women and laughs at his jokes about getting into trouble.
- He supports Arthur's sacking of Eva Smith — "_You couldn't have done anything else._"
- He's business-minded and is committed to his work in the same way that Arthur Birling is.
- He and Arthur are the ones who are determined to take action at the end to find out whether the Inspector or the girl were real.

# Gerald's language shows he doesn't feel sorry for his actions

## Priestly makes Gerald sound less passionate than Gerald can distance himself from the tragedy.

- He is the first character to use the word "_hoax_" — he's very keen to prove the Inspector was a fake and clear everyone's names.
- At the end of the play, he says "_Everything's all right now, Sheila_" to comfort her. He doesn't seem to have learnt any lessons.

# He thinks he's done nothing wrong

- Gerald says that Eva/Daisy "_didn't blame me at all_". Perhaps the audience don't blame Gerald much at first because Eva/Daisy didn't.
- The Inspector isn't too harsh on him because Gerald "_had some affection for her and made her happy for a time_". Gerald had some positive effects on Eva/Daisy's life.
- But then he left her and went off on a business trip. He effectively made her homeless.

# Gerald's not simply bad or good

## This is a difficult one. Priestley's made it hard to see Gerald as simply good or bad. He's a complex character.

- Gerald is confident but he's also stubborn — he doesn't learn much about himself over the course of the play. The Inspector points out Gerald's hypocrisy:
- The Inspector asks Gerald whether he thinks "_young women ought to be protected against unpleasant and disturbing things?_". Gerald says yes, thinking of Sheila.
- But it's people like Gerald who are thing the unpleasant and disturbing things to women like Eva/Daisy — he uses her and then discards her. This applies just as much to Mr Birling and other men like him who have the same attitudes.
- Gerald has the ability to separate his public, respectable image from secret, private acts — something Eric doesn't get the hang of.

- A liar: "_I wasn't telling you a complete lie_"
