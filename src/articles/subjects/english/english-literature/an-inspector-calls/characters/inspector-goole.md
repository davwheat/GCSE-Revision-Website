At the end of the end of the play it is still not clear who or what the Inspector was. This uncertainty make a big difference for some of the Birlings, but not to others. 'Who was he?' and 'Why did he call?' are quite different questions.

# The Inspector taking charge

- He arrives unexpectedly. He just says he's here to ask some questions.
- He's an outsider. He does not have a lot in common with the Birlings.
- The Inspector leaves after delivering a speech about social responsibility. When Gerald learns that the Inspector is probably a fake, the older characters forget his speech and try to avoid the blame.
- He is described as authoritative and imposing, although he is not a large man, his presence fills then room.

# Driving force of the play

## The Inspector continues to keep things rolling in the play by asking controversial questions.

- He starts off with a summary of the events "_Suicide, of course._"
- He forces more information out of people by being blunt and saying what the characters are trying to avoid. When Gerald describes how he met Daisy Renton, the Inspector asks "_And then you decided to keep her... as your mistress_" However this is not really a question. This then forces Gerald to admit the truth.
- He reveals new information which then heightens the drama, for example when he drops "_that this girl was going to have a child_" into the conversation.

# The Inspector's 'calling' is pretty ominous

- The word "_calls_" sounds very casual, as if he is just dropping in.
- "_Calls_" is a deceptive word to use about the Inspector. He may appear casual and spontaneous but in fact he's single-minded and calculating. If anything he is the the one who "_calls_" the shots.
- Another inspector then "_calls_" the Birlings at the the end of the play.
- The title of the play is echoed in Edna's words as she announces the arrival of Inspector Google at the start of the play and in the telephone call at the end.

# Use of emotive language

- Inspector Google is at the house to stir things. He does this with he use of emotive language.
- He describes Eva/Daisy as a "_pretty_" and "_lively_" girl. These attractive words make the audience more sympathetic towards her.
- This sympathy is strengthened by the harsh tone used to describe her. He says that she's now lying "_with a burn-out inside on a slab_".
- Shelia is "_rather distressed_" by the Inspector's language and says that she "_can't help thinking about this girl ... destroying herself_".

# Shock Tactics

- He answers his own questions if he's not happy with the response. For example when Sybil refuses to admit there was a committee meeting he says, "_You know very well there was, Mrs Birling._"
- He follows up his questions with even more questions until he gets the confession he wants, e.g when Sybil won't say she convinced the committee to reject Eva/Daisy's appeal he asks "_Was it or was it not your influence_".
- He's blunt, "_You're not even sorry now, when you know what happened_", and is prepared to ask personal questions. For example when he asked Gerald "_Were you in love with her?_".

# He knows how to make a entrance and exit

- The Inspector's timing is crucial. Priestly has the Inspector ring the bell just as Arthur says "_a man has to mind his own business_". As if Birling's announcement summons the Inspector to prove the opposite.
- The Inspector uses exits as a clever tactic. Leaving Shelia and Gerald alone lets Shelia interrogate Gerald and allows the time for suspicion to break them apart. This makes it easier to get Gerald to confess when the Inspector returns.
- The Inspector's language gets more dramatic, which builds on the tension and emotion of the final scene. He claims it easier to get Gerald to confess when the Inspector returns.
- After his last exit there's a sudden silence because no one else has been speaking. The audience, like the characters on stage, are left "_staring, subdued and wondering_".

# Who really is the Inspector?

- At the end of the play, the audience aren't sure who or what the Inspector is.
- He claims he found "_a rough sort of diary_" kept by Eva/Daisy. but his identity isn't certain, and the audience aren't sure whether he ever existed. So, the diary might be be a bluff to stop any questions being asked.
- Why he has so much knowledge and power is never properly explained. He could be a ghost, or he could represent the spirit of a religious or moral figure.

# More than a police inspector?

- In a way, he represents the police and the courts as he is trying to work out the truth, like in a murder mystery.
- Because he is not a police officer, Mr and Mrs Birling don't believe he has the authority to tell them off.
- Eric and Shelia realise that his moral judgement is just as important as his legal power.
- Goole has the attitude of a philosopher and social commentator, and the knowledge of a ghost or spirit delivering a prophesy.

# His authority strengthens his strong moral tone

- Whatever Goole is, his unsettling presence might just be down to confidence. He knows how to create an air of uncertainty and reel everyone in.
- He makes sure everyone recognises that he is in charge.
- He takes control and leads the events, leaving them confused but never Goole.
- He "_massively_" interrupts which means that he cuts into the dialogue "_with authority_". For example when he tells Birling that Eric can "wait his turn".
- His authority makes people take him more seriously and makes everything he says sound more important.

# He is from a different world

- The Inspector doesn't play gold and he is not impressed by Mr Birlings achievements as a former Alderman and Lord Mayor.
- He talks about taboo subjects like sex and politics.
- He interrupts, repeats and pauses in ways which were not the norm in middle-class pre-war England. He doesn't follow etiquette.

# Classless

- The Inspector appears to come form outside the class system that the rest of the characters are in. This make him "_classless_"
- The inspector doesn't recognise any of the Birlings ideas of class and thus treats everyone the same.
- Instead he says that "_We are members of one body_" so classes shouldn't succumb the needs of others.

# Priestley uses the Inspector as a mouthpiece

- The Inspector stands outside the class system making him a outsider in the play.
- But he doesn't take a neutral position, he is on Eva/Daisy's side and tells the Birlings exactly what he thinks of them.
- Priestley's own views are reflected in the opinions and actions of the Inspector. You could say that the Inspector is Priestley's socialist mouthpiece.
- This is most apparent in the Inspectors final speech as the speech is aimed at the Birlings but could also apply to the audience.
- The play has a strong message about looking out for one another and the Inspector is the one delivering this message
