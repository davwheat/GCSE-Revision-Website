Arthur Birling is the head of the Birling family. He is the the boss of his own company. He even plays golf with the big shots. But he is so bothered about money and power that he can't think about anything, or anybody else.

# He is pleased with himself

- He seems to be very confident. He is head of his family and boss of his own business.
- He likes to be in control and he keeps reminding everyone that he is in charge, For example Birling doesn't want to be told what to do, and "_angrily_" tells the Inspector, "_Well... if you don't mind... I'll find out first_".
- Over the course of the play, Birling's authority is undermined. The Inspector reveals Birling as an ambitious, anxious man who'll ignore the needs of others to keep up profits and a good reputation.

# He is successful and ambitious

- Birling hints that his company could merge with the larger company owned by Gerald's father. He sees his daughter's marriage a bit like a business deal and hopes it will bring "_lower costs and higher prices_"
- Birling thinks he is a successful because he is a "_hard-headed, practical man of business_". He has the same attitude to all areas of his life.
- He is very optimistic about the future. He thinks that strikes won't be a problem for his company and dismisses any fear of war as just some "_silly little war scares_".

# Lack of responsibility over Eva's death

- Birling finds it difficult to think about other people. He doesn't believe in "_community and all that nonsense_", instead seeing other people as "_cheap labour_".
- Birling didn't just refuse higher wages for his workers, he actively made things worse for them. He personally fired the ringleaders of the strike.
- Birling is selfish and self-centred. He'd rather pass off the Inspector's visit as a "_hoax_" or a joke than face up to what he's done.

# He links to be respected and to be in control

- Birling's a public figure in Brumley and obsessed with his status. When his good name's threatened he's terrified and would "_give thousands_" (bribe) to avoid scandal.
- He isn't used to being challenged. The Inspector barely says twenty words before Birling shows "_a touch a impatience_".
- Birling's family is falling apart, and he can do nothing about it. He blames the Inspector for making a "_nasty mess_" of the night's celebrations.

# He is a anxious man

- Birling desperately tries to win the Crofts' approval by talking about a knighthood and by getting Gerald's father's favourite port.
- Birling tries to make himself seem important by drawing attention to his connections with influential people. For example he plays golf with the Chief Inspector.
- The Inspector threatens Birling's middle-class values the reputation of his company, his important connections. Birling is rattled by this. He has spent his entire life believing that these things matter.

# He uses his authoritative language to be in control

## Priestley uses stage directions and careful language choices to help create Birling's character:

- Priestley writes that Birling should be "_provincial in his speech_", which means he has a regional accent. Accent and social class were closely linked, so it would be clear that Birling was a middle-class businessman rather than upper-class.
- Birling has the most continuous speech in the play, he likes to talk and doesn't like being interrupted. When Eric tries to correct him, Birling ignores him, saying "_Just let me finish, Eric_".
- Birling repeatedly shouts "_Rubbish!_" to dismiss what other people have said. But he finishes his own sentences with "_of course_", to make his own claims seem obvious and matter-of-fact.

# Other quotes

- Ambitious: "_there's a very good chance of a knighthood_"
- Business-minded: "_a hard-headed, practical man of business_"
- Selfish: "_a man has to make his own way_"
- Anxious: "_there'll be a public scandal ... unless we're lucky_"
