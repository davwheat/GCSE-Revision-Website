# Macbeth is a good man who performs evil acts

- At the beginning Macbeth is noble and Duncan sees his potential for greatness, so gives him the title of Thane of Cawdor.
- Once he's tempted to give in to his ambitions, Macbeth's goodness is overcome by his evil desires. It shows that even good people can be led astray by ambition and power.
- Macbeth becomes increasingly evil as he becomes hardened to the many crimes he commits.
- The struggle for the crown is between good and evil. Macbeth is the evil "tyrant" who must be killed before he destroys Scotland.

# Evil is linked to gender

- Lady Macbeth links cruelty and aggression with masculinity. She wants the spirits to "unsex" her and fill her with "direst cruelty" - she thinks her femininity holds her back from taking violent action.
- Masculine ideas of evil focus on violence and bloodshed. Though she wants to be more like a man, she relies on manipulation rather than action. She sees Macbeth's weakness and uses emotional blackmail to persuade him to commit evil.
- The Witches' gender is ambiguous. Banquo says that they "should be women" but they have beards. Like Lady Macbeth, they rely on manipulation rather than physical force.

# Battles represent the conflict between good and evil

- Shakespeare uses battles to symbolise good and evil
- In the opening scene, there's a battle between Scotland and Norway - the enemy army is lead by a traitor, "merciless Macdonald", whose "villanies of nature" show that he's evil.
- The play ends with a battle, this time against Macbeth. Malcolm's men have "dear causes" and fight to "dew the sovereign flower" - in other words, to restore the rightful King. Macbeth is an "abhorred tyrant" who represents evil.
