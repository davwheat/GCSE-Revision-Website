# The Witches are a supernatural force

- The Witches are an evil supernatural force - their "strange intelligence" and ability to predict the future gives them power over humans. However, when they're planning to harm the sea captain, they say that his ship "cannot be lost", which hints that their power is limited.
- They're not in many scenes but they drive the action of the play. It's unlikely that Macbeth would've committed so many terrible crimes if he hadn't been influenced by the witches.
- The witches are associated with chaos. They try to impose an unnatural order on what's good and natural. Macbeth says they "untie the winds" and make "castles topple". The witches are motivated by "destruction" rather than goodness. They represent the struggle between the natural and our natural order.
- Shakespeare presents them as completely evil. They are cruel inhuman and don't show any remorse. In fact they celebrate evil.

# Visions are supernatural signs of guilt

Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have visions which remind the audience of their terrible guilt:

## Act 2, Scene 1

Macbeth sees a vision of a dagger just as he's about to kill Duncan. Is not clear whether it's leading and Duncan or warning him against murder. It represents the "bloody business" he is about to do.

## Act 3, Scene 4

Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost which gives him a "strange infirmity". Nobody else can see the ghost which suggests that it is a sign of Macbeth's guilty conscience.

## Act 5, Scene 1

Lady Macbeth is driven mad as she imagines that her hands will "ne'er be clean" of Duncan's blood. Her guilt is so great that she kills herself.

- The visions are ambiguous. They could be real or imaginary.
- The visions fill the characters who see them with fear. Macbeth is "blanched with fear" by Banquo's ghost and his language is agitated and nervous: "Prithee, see there! Behold, look, lo!". His fear has made him lose control of his speech. Macbeth calls his own reaction a "strange infirmity" - it links to other signs of madness later in the play.
- Lady Macbeth's language when she sleepwalks is desperate, "O, o, o!", and shows that she's disturbed by the vision of blood on her hands. The Doctor says that her heart is "sorely charged" - he sees that the vision is the result of her guilty conscience.
