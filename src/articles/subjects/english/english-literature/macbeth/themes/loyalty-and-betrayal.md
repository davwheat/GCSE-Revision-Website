# Characters show loyalty through their actions
- There is a difference between characters who say they are loyal (like Macbeth) and those who show loyalty through their actions.
- The characters show loyalty to different things:

| Country | King | Beliefs |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Macduff is loyal to Scotland. He chooses to go to England to ask Malcolm to defend his country instead of protecting his family. He'd rather leave Scotland than see it be ruled by a bad king. | The thanes are loyal to Duncan because he's been a "great" king. Macbeth gives Duncan "service and loyalty" by fighting for him in Act 1. | Banquo is loyal to his own sense of honour - he says that he will keep his "allegiance clear". He won't let ambition or the Witches' prophecies affect him. |

- When characters betray their loyalty, it's usually to pursue their own selfish desires.

# Loyalty is rewarded, but betrayal is punished
- Duncan has the old Thane of Cawdor executed for betraying him and rewards Macbeth's loyalty by giving him the title. The play has a circular structure - it ends with Macbeth being killed for betraying Scotland and Malcolm rewarding the thane's loyalty.
- Macbeth betrays his own sense of right and wrong. This eventually leads to his loss of self-worth and his death.
- Betrayal is often linked to power. Power (in the form of titles) can be given or taken away depending on a person's loyalty.

# The Macbeths pretend to be loyal
- Macbeth is initially loyal to Duncan as "his kinsman and his subject" - this makes it even more shocking when he puts his own desires ahead of his loyalty to the king.
- Lady Macbeth fakes an appearance of loyalty. She tells Duncan that she and Macbeth are "Your servants ever", even though they're plotting his murder. It shows how easily she can pretend to be loyal.
- Shakespeare juxtaposes Lady Macbeth's plotting to kill Duncan with her welcoming him into their castle. This develops her character and makes her murderous intentions more dramatic.
