# Appearance can be deceptive
- In Macbeth, characters often hide their thoughts and pretend to be something that they're not.
- Lady Macbeth encourages Macbeth to appear to be so good nobody suspects that he plans to kill Duncan. "look like th'innocent flower, / But be the serpent under't" - the serpent is a link to Satan who tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
- Macbeth knows that he needs a "False face" to hide his murderous acts. However, when Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost, his face is "the very painting" of his fear and betrays his feelings.
- At first, Lady Macbeth has no trouble disguising her evil behaviour. She pretends to faint with shock when Duncan's death is discovered. However, her guilt becomes too great to hide and she starts sleepwalking.

# Meanings of words are unclear
- The Witches' chant "Fair is foul, and foul is fair" suggests that things that appear good are actually evil.
- They use language to trick Macbeth and convince him of a false reality- they tell him that "none of woman born" will harm him, which gives him the false confidence to fight to protect his reign.
- Other characters speak using paradoxes, e.g. Macbeth says "Nothing is / But what is not". These paradoxes create uncertainty - they show that nobody can tell what's real.

# Some characters trust too much in appearances
- Duncan trusts Macbeth and dies for it, even though he made the same mistake by trusting the disloyal Thane of Cawdor. When this happens, Duncan says, "There's no art / To find the mind's construction in the face" - he thinks that there's no way of telling what someone is really like.
- Macbeth knows that reality and appearances don't always match up, but he completely trusts the Witches' prophecies. This leads to his downfall.
- In contrast, Malcolm is immediately sceptical that Duncan was murdered by his servants and suspects one of the thanes: "To show an unfelt sorrow is an office / Which the false man does easy". His awareness of what "false" men can do causes him to flee and probably saves his life.
