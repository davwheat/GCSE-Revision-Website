# He is more honourable than Macbeth

- He is a thane, like Macbeth. He is there when the Witches make their prophecies.
- He is praised for his courage in battle - just like Macbeth. However, while Macbeth is guided by his own selfish desires, Banquo has "a wisdom that doth guide his valour". This suggests he thinks before he acts, and does what is right.
- Banquo isn't corrupted by his own ambition unlike Macbeth (though he is ambitious), so Banquo remains honourable.
- Macbeth promises to "honour" Banquo for his loyalty, but Banquo chooses to keep his "allegiance clear" - his conscience is more important to his than power or glory.

# He doesn't trust the Witches

- He behaves rationally when meeting them - questioning their existence as he doesn't trust them. In contrast Macbeth is "rapt withall"
- Banquo is aware that the Witches could be "fantastical" and is perceptive enough to realise that they are "instruments of darkness" that could "win us to our harm". He's more cautious about believing what he sees than Macbeth.

# He doesn't act to protect himself

- Banquo suspects that Macbeth murdered Duncan - "I fear / Thou play'dst most foully". However he doesn't act on his suspicions as he remembers the predictions that he will be the "father / Of many kings". This shows that even the most honourable characters are influenced by ambition.
- Macbeth sees Banquo as a threat - he says there is no one except Banquo "Whose being I do fear". When Banquo is assassinated he says "O, treachery!", showing that he didn't expect Macbeth to betray him.
