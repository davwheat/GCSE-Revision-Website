# He is more honourable than Macbeth

- He is a thane, like Macbeth. He is there when the Witches make their prophecies.
- He is praised for his courage in battle - just like Macbeth. However, while Macbeth is guided by his own selfish desires, Banquo has "_a wisdom that doth guide his valour_". This suggests he thinks before he acts, and does what is right.
- Banquo isn't corrupted by his own ambition unlike Macbeth (though he is ambitious), so Banquo remains honourable.
- Macbeth promises to "_honour_" Banquo for his loyalty, but Banquo chooses to keep his "_allegiance clear_" - his conscience is more important to his than power or glory.

# He doesn't trust the Witches

- He behaves rationally when meeting them - questioning their existence as he doesn't trust them. In contrast Macbeth is "_rapt withall_"
- Banquo is aware that the Witches could be "_fantastical_" and is perceptive enough to realise that they are "_instruments of darkness_" that could "_win us to our harm_". He's more cautious about believing what he sees than Macbeth.

# He doesn't act to protect himself

- Banquo suspects that Macbeth murdered Duncan - "_I fear_ / _Thou play'dst most foully_". However he doesn't act on his suspicions as he remembers the predictions that he will be the "_father_ / _Of many kings_". This shows that even the most honourable characters are influenced by ambition.
- Macbeth sees Banquo as a threat - he says there is no one except Banquo "_Whose being I do fear_". When Banquo is assassinated he says "_O, treachery!_", showing that he didn't expect Macbeth to betray him.
