# Macduff is honest and sincere

- He is a nobleman. He's honest and has integrity, so he acts as a contrast to Macbeth. He discovers Duncan's murder and is horrified by it.
- He doesn't go to Macbeth's coronation, suggesting he is suspicious, instead going to Fife.
- Macduff has a strong sense of loyalty and love for his country. "_O Scotland, Scotland!_"
- He is brave - he fights and kills Macbeth.

# But he puts his country before his family

- He makes a mistake by going to England. He leaves his wife and children unprotected. This decision shows a strong sense of justice but also lack of wisdom.
- "_All my pretty ones?_ / _Did you say all?_" - overcome with grief when he hears about Macbeth murdering his family.
- He kills Macbeth to put the rightful heir on the throne and to avenge his family.

# Lady Macduff cannot understand her husband's actions

- When he goes to England, she says he lacks "_the natural touch_" - she thinks his behaviour shows a lack of fatherly love.
- She shows courage as she comforts her son, calling him "_Poor bird_". Her love and affection for him are clear. They speak in prose, which makes the scene feel natural and homely - this makes the murders even more shocking and horrible.
- The above contrasts to Lady Macbeth who says "_Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums_ / _And dashed the brains out_" (about killing her own baby)
