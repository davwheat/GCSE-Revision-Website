# Macduff is honest and sincere

- He is a nobleman. He's honest and has integrity, so he acts as a contrast to Macbeth. He discovers Duncan's murder and is horrified by it.
- He doesn't go to Macbeth's coronation, suggesting he is suspicious, instead going to Fife.
- Macduff has a strong sense of loyalty and love for his country. 'O Scotland, Scotland!"
- He is brave - he fights and kills Macbeth.

# But he puts his country before his family

- He makes a mistake by going to England. He leaves his wife and children unprotected. This decision shows a strong sense of justice but also lack of wisdom.
- "All my pretty ones? / Did you say all?" - overcome with grief when he hears about Macbeth murdering his family.
- He kills Macbeth to put the rightful heir on the throne and to avenge his family.

# Lady Macduff cannot understand her husband's actions

- When he goes to England, she says he lacks "the natural touch" - she thinks his behaviour shows a lack of fatherly love.
- She shows courage as she comforts her son, calling him "Poor bird". Her love and affection for him are clear. They speak in prose, which makes the scene feel natural and homely - this makes the murders even more shocking and horrible.
- The above contrasts to Lady Macbeth who says "Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums / And dashed the brains out" (about killing her own baby)
