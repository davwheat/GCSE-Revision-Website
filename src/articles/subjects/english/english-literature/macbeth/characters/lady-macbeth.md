- She is obsessed with nightmares of her actions and finally commits suicide "_Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
  perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!_".

- Macbeth has succumbed to her, and treats her as a equal, "_my dearest partner of greatness_".

# She is an agent of the supernatural

- First she her true intentions in the opening scene, where she calls upon the "_Spirits that tend on mortal thoughts_" to deprive her of her feminine instinct to care.
- She is determined to make sure that the prophecy is true "_Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be_ / _What thou art promised._"
- She calls on the spirits just as the witches did "_unsex me here_". She also goes on to ask spirits to take away all her natural feelings, and instead fill her full of "_direst cruelty_". She asks them to stop up the "_passage of remorse_" and to replace her milk with "_gall_".
