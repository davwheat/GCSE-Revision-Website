# The other nobleman

- Lennox, Rose, Menteith, Angus and Caithness are all thanes. They aren't that important but show the power shifts in the play.
- Lennox sarcastically says that Macbeth "_nobly_" and "_wisely_" killed Duncan's guards. This shows how the thanes suspect that Macbeth killed Duncan.
- The thanes say that they will "_give obedience where 'tis truly owed_" - they'll be loyal to the rightful king.

# A few others

- The Porter in Act 2 is there to relieve some tension between the darker and tragic parts in the play.
- Three Murderers appear in Act 3. They show how ruthless Macbeth is but also that he is unwilling to commit more murders. They show how desperate and cruel Macbeth is.
