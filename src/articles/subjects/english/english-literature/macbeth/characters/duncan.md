# He is kind, but too trusting

- kind, "let me enfold thee / And hold thee to my heart".
- trusting, "There's no art / To find the mind's construction in the face".
- a good king, "So clear in his great office".
- Nobody has a bad word to say about Duncan. Even Macbeth says "his virtues / Will plead like angels".
- Duncan's flaw is that he is too trusting: he describes the man that murders him as "a gentleman on whom I built / An absolute trust".
- However he can be firm (he executed the old Thane of Cawdor for betraying him).

# He is an example of a good king

- He is a model king: kind, honest and fair.
- Macbeth says he is "a most sainted king," reminding the audience that kings were chosen by God (when Macbeth was not).
- He is a HUGE contrast to when the tyrannous king Macbeth is in power. Duncan puts Scotland's needs ahead of his own. Duncan is loved, Macbeth is feared and hated.

# Duncan isn't like other men

- He isn't a soldier like Macbeth or Macduff. He's gentle and doesn't fight for himself, but sensibly sends his best soldiers.
- He's not afraid to be emotional. He shows "drops of sorrow" because he's so happy and talks about his "gentle senses" - it could be seen as 'unmanly'.
- The fact that Duncan is depicted as a model king but not necessarily 'manly', leads the audience to question whether a good leader needs to be a vicious warrior.
