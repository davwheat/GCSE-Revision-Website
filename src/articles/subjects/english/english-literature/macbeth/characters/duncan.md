# He is kind, but too trusting

- kind, "_let me enfold thee_ / _And hold thee to my heart_".
- trusting, "_There's no art_ / _To find the mind's construction in the face_".
- a good king, "_So clear in his great office_".
- Nobody has a bad word to say about Duncan. Even Macbeth says "_his virtues_ / _Will plead like angels_".
- Duncan's flaw is that he is too trusting: he describes the man that murders him as "_a gentleman on whom I built_ / _An absolute trust_".
- However he can be firm (he executed the old Thane of Cawdor for betraying him).

# He is an example of a good king

- He is a model king: kind, honest and fair.
- Macbeth says he is "_a most sainted king,_" reminding the audience that kings were chosen by God (when Macbeth was not).
- He is a HUGE contrast to when the tyrannous king Macbeth is in power. Duncan puts Scotland's needs ahead of his own. Duncan is loved, Macbeth is feared and hated.

# Duncan isn't like other men

- He isn't a soldier like Macbeth or Macduff. He's gentle and doesn't fight for himself, but sensibly sends his best soldiers.
- He's not afraid to be emotional. He shows "_drops of sorrow_" because he's so happy and talks about his "_gentle senses_" - it could be seen as unmanly.
- The fact that Duncan is depicted as a model king but not necessarily manly, leads the audience to question whether a good leader needs to be a vicious warrior.
