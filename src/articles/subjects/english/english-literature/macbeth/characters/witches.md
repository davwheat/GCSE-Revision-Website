# They have supernatural powers

- The Three Witches are also known as the Weird Sisters. They look unnatural and evil.
- The Witches can see the future. They seem to act out of malice - they don't gain anything but they just enjoy causing trouble.
- They speak in short rhyming lines. It sets them apart from other characters. Lines like "_Eye of newt, and toe of frog_ / _Wool of bat, and tongue of dog_" make them sound gruesome and evil.
- Their line "_Fair is foul, and foul is fair_" shows that nothing is as it seems in the play.

# They're evil, but they don't tell Macbeth to murder Duncan

- The Witches are typically accompanied by "_Thunder and lightning_" (pathetic fallacy) making the atmosphere dark and frightening.
- They make prophecies but don't explain how they take place. This takes advantage of Macbeth's "_Vaulting ambition_", and so they use it to control his actions.
- They predict he will be king - which pushes him to murder Duncan.
- They confuse Macbeth using paradoxes - for example telling him Banquo will be "_Lesser than Macbeth, and greater_". By not being clear about what the future holds, they keep control of Macbeth.
- They trick Macbeth by making predictions that give him a false sense of security, such as "_none of woman born_ / _Shall harm Macbeth_".
