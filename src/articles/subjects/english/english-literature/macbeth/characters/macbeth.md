# He is ambitious but easily led astray

- He is ambitious: "_I have no spur_ / _To prick the sides of my intent, but only_ / _Vaulting ambition_"
- He is brave: "_brave Macbeth - well he deserves that name_"
- He is guilty: "_Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood_ / _Clean from my hand?_"
- The way Macbeth speaks reflects his state of mind. He asks lots of questions when he's feeling uncertain or guilty: "_Whence is that knocking?_ / _How is't with me, when every noise appals me?_".
- At the start and end of the play he is more certain and confident: "_Stars, hide you fires_", "_I will not yield_".

# He is a brave hero

- At the start he is described as a "_valiant_" warrior. Ross compares him to "_Bellona's bridegroom_" - a comparison to the God of War (Mars).
- He impresses the King and shows his loyalty. Macbeth is most comfortable on the battlefield where he doesn't have to worry about his guilty conscience or morality of his actions.

# He is a brutal murderer

- He is a brutal murderer. "_I am settled and bend up_ / _Each corporal agent to this terrible feat_". He kills Duncan, the Macduffs and Banquo.

# He struggles with his conscience

- Macbeth struggles with his conscience. He has a strong sense of right and wrong. He worries about the consequences of his actions yet still does many of them which makes them even more shocking to the audience.
- After he kills Duncan, his guilty conscience makes him imagine things: "_Macbeth does murder sleep_". Then he sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet.
- By the end of the play he seams world-weary and cynical - he no longer feels guilty because he feels his actions don't matter and that life means "_nothing_".

# He is easily influenced

- He is easily influenced: Macbeth does what Lady Macbeth wants because he doesn't want to be seen as a "_coward_" and to be "_more the man_". Links to masculinity, strength and courage themes.
- He is also influenced by the super-natural. The first time he meets the Witches he trusts them first time, saying "_Two truths are told_". He sees the dagger that leads him to kill Duncan. When the prophecies come true he relies on the witches even more.
