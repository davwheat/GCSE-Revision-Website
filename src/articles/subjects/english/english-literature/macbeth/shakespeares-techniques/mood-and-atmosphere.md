# Shakespeare creates atmosphere in different ways

- Setting
- Humour
- Language
- Use of the supernatural
- Different senses

# Different settings create different moods

The Witches always appear in a spooky setting, usually in deserted places. This gives a sense of isolation and secrecy and highlights the fact that they are separated from the rest of the characters. They are often accompanied by "_thunder and lightning_", which makes them seem menacing. Each apparition is introduced with more "_thunder_" so they appear threatening.

A lot of the scenes take place in and around Macbeth's castles in Scotland. This reminds the audience that the Macbeths are noble. However, the way they act contrasts sharply with this - their actions are not noble at all.

Most of Act 5 takes place as Malcolm's army advances, which highlights the violence that occurs throughout the play.

# Language sets the scene and creates atmosphere

- In Act 1, Scene 1, the Witches appear in "_fog and filthy air_". This creates a gloomy atmosphere and also makes them seem ambiguous as they can't be seen properly.
- In Act 1, Scene 6, Shakespeare uses dramatic irony - Duncan describes Macbeth's castle as "_pleasant_", not knowing that he's going to be murdered there.
- Act 2, Scene 1 takes place on a dark night - Banquo says the "_candles are all out_" (there are no stars). Macbeth also says "_Stars, hide your fires_". This is an appropriate setting for murder.
- Language can create an atmosphere of its own - one that isn't linked to the setting, but more to do with what's going on in the character's minds. In Act 4, Scene 1, the Witches talk about "_poisoned entrails_", and "_Finger of birth-strangled babe_". This unpleasant, gruesome language reflects their evil intentions.
- Shakespeare uses violent language to reveal Lady Macbeth's true nature. Her description of how she would kill her own child creates an evil atmosphere.
- He also uses short lines of dialogue, questions and exclamations to create feelings of panic and confusion.

# He uses senses to set the scenes

By making the characters describe what they can see or hear, Shakespeare makes the scenes more vivid - it helps the audience imagine what's happening, especially as there wouldn't have been many props.

- When Macduff has just discovered Duncan's body, he says it will "_destroy your sight_ / _With a new Gorgon_". This emphasises the horror of the discovery - he feels he has gone blind from seeing something so terrible.
- Earlier in the play, Duncan's arrival is introduces by a "_Flourish_". This contrasts with the "_hideous trumpet_" and "_alarum bell_" that announce his death, and shows how the atmosphere has changed.
- On the night of Duncan's murder, Lennox hears "_strange screams of death_", which create a dark, frightening atmosphere.
- The army approaches to the sound of a "_Drum_". The sounds of the battle highlight the violence that happens throughout the play.

# Unnatural and supernatural events create tension

- Seemingly supernatural events, such as the dagger Macbeth sees and Banquo's ghost, create a tense, uneasy atmosphere. It's uncomfortable as its not clear if these visions exist or if Macbeth is going mad.
- After Duncan's murder, there are a number of "_unnatural_" events, e.g. horses eating each other and day turning to "_dark night_". This creates a troubled atmosphere, because the natural order has been disturbed.
- Every appearance of the Witches has a dark, spooky atmosphere. It's not just the setting that creates this mood - their "_imperfect_" speech and "_Filthy_" appearance add to the atmosphere.

# The Porter provides light relief - but also increases the tension

- One of the few bits of comedy in the play comes in Act 2, Scene 3, when a drunken Porter rambles for a bit. This comic interlude delays the discovery of Duncan's body, which increases the tension.
- Even the atmosphere here is dark - the Porter talks about "_hell_" and "_Beelzebub_" (the devil). He refers to Macbeth's castle as "_hell-gate_" and calls himself the "_devil-porter_". This suggests that the visitors are entering hell and to be greeted by the devil (Macbeth).
