Shakespeare set out the play to emphasise important themes (such as introducing the Witches in Act 1 Scene 1 to let the audience know that the supernatural theme will be throughout the play).

He also uses the structure to set the mood. For example in Act 2 Scene 1 Macbeth goes to murder Duncan which sets the dark atmosphere for the whole of Act 2.

# Tragedies have a set structure

- The first part builds up to the turning point (Duncan's murder)
- The second part deals with the consequences of this
- Which then lead to the main character's downfall.
  This structure helps Shakespeare develop the characters. Macbeth starts off as an honourable, moral character, but he's corrupted by his ambition (his fatal flaw). Macbeth also has a circular structure - it starts and ends with a battle to defeat a "_merciless tyrant_". This shows that the events have come full circle and order is restored at the end of the play.

# Length of scenes

Shakespeare uses short scenes to speed up the action and make the play more exciting:

- For example Act 5 is made up of nine short scenes where a lot happens!
  Long scenes let Shakespeare explore his characters' emotions and reveal their true characters:
- In Act 4, Scene 3, Malcolm tests Macduff by claiming to be unfit to be King. Macduff's reaction shows he is loyal to Malcolm and his country. Later in that scene Macduff hears about his family too and the grief he shows, tells the audience that he cares for his family also.

# Foreshadowing

Shakespeare hints at a lot of things that happen later in the play, especially near the start:

- In Act 1, Scene 1 the Witches let the audience know that they're evil ("_Fair is foul_") and that they're going to meet Macbeth. This creates dramatic tension because it makes the audience wonder who Macbeth is and what the witches are planning for him.
- In Act 1, Scene 3f the Witches tell Macbeth that he'll be King, which plants the idea in both Macbeth's head and the audience's minds and this creates anticipation.
- The apparition's prophecies in Act 4, Scene 1 hint at things to come. The audience suspects the prophecies will come true, but they don't know how which builds suspense.

# Suspense

Shakespeare leaves the audience in little doubt it's going to be a tragedy - but he still keeps a few questions open about what is going to happen.
