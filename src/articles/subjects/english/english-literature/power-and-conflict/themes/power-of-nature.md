# Overview

- Nature is a powerful that can cause suffering and destruction.
- It is usually personified in poetry to show its effects in human terms.
- It has the power to change humans and change their decisions.

# Nature as an enemy

## Exposure

Nature is shown as the enemy to the soldiers in the trenches. It has "_merciless iced east winds that knive_" them and snowflakes that "_come feeling_" for their faces with "_fingering stealth_".

The men are not expecting to die from the gunfire, but from the exposure to the elements.

## Storm on the Island

The island is inhabitable because nothing can grow there. The earth is "_wizened_" and there are no trees or "_stacks_".

What the islanders really fear is the nature. Words that connote war are used to suggest that the island is under attack from nature. It's "_bombarded by the empty air_" and the wind "_strafes_" it.

# Natures effect on humans

## Kamikaze

The beauty of nature has a effect on the pilot that is one of the reasons why he flow back home.

The dangers from nature are also shown by the "_turbulent inrush_" of waves and the "_muscular_, _dangerous_" tuna.

This shows humans are at the mercy of nature and the "_turbulent_" waves could crush a boat at any time.

## The Prelude

This poem shows the true beauty of nature with the "_circles glittering_" on the lake and the "_sparkling light_".

The speaker seems to be inspired and relaxed by nature.

When we first see the mountain, it is a example of how nature is personified. It is shown to be a terrifying and monstrous "_upreared its head_".

The power of the mountain also convinces the speaker to return the stolen boat showing how nature can effect humans behaviour and decisions.

The phrase "_a trouble to my dreams_" at the end of the poem, shows how nature has changed the speaker from his experience and the "_pleasant images_" of nature, have now been replace with more sinister ones.
