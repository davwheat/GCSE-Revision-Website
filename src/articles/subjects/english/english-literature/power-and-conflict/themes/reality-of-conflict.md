# Overview

- People experience loss when they're separated from someone of something they love
- An scarcity of hope can lead to negativity and despair.

# Conflict causes loss of people or places

## Poppies

The mother feels like she lost her son when he joined the army. She acts as if he had died, she leans against the "_war memorial_" and mentions "_Armistice Sunday_".

The loss she experienced is emphasised by references to textures and the senses. She traces "_the inscriptions_" on the war memorial and listens for her son's voice "_on the wind_". This shows how desperate her desire to find a connection to him is.

## The Emigrée

The speaker is nostalgic of the place she left as a child, the opening phrase "_There was once a country_..." frames the poem with the sense of loss she feels for the place.

The loss is heightened by the fact that the speaker retains an "_impression of sunlight_", a positive idealised view of the city.

There are suggestions that the conflict is the reason for the speakers loss, the city "_may be at war_", and the speaker describes herself as an "_Emigrée_" suggesting that she was forced to leave.

## Kamikaze

Although the pilot chose to avoid dying in the war, his family still lose him. Their shame causes them to treat him as if he "_no longer existed_".
The daughter's statement he "_was no longer the father we loved_" hints at the emotional pain that this loss caused both the pilot and his family.

# People without power often feel hopeless

## London

There is little positivity in the poem, the speaker refers to the lack of freedom "_the chartered Thames_", innocence "_blasts the new-born infant's tear_" and morality "_harlot's curse_".

There is a lack of hope with a no sense that anyone can do anything to improve the situation.

The final image of plagued "_marriage hearse_" implies the cycle of suffering will continue.

## Exposure

The men in the trenches have no hope of things improving. The dejected line, "_We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy_" emphasises that their lives are miserable and filled with suffering.

Even thinking about home provides no hope for the men, they understand that they are "_dying_" and know that at home "_the doors are closed_" to them.
