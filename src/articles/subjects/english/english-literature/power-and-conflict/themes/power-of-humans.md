# Overview

- Humans use power to benefit themselves rather then others, this leads to people being injured or worse so, killed.
- The power of Humans is minuscule in comparison to the power of nature, which is vast and timeless.

# Human abuse of power

## My Last Duchess

The duke is obsessed with power, this is seen in how he controls who can see his duchess.

There is a indication to the reader that the duke had his wife killed "_I gave commands_ / _Then all smiles stopped_". These quotes also have a sinister feel to them.

As the Duke does not explain his actions, it tells the reader that he doest not feel accountable for what happened.

The poems form shows his absolute power, this is done through how we only hear the dukes voice.

The use of rhyming couplets show his control.

## Checking Out Me History

The speaker is angry that in his education, he has only been given a one-sided education on history.

The metaphors of blindness "_Blind me to me own identity_", show how the speaker believes he's been treated badly by those in power.

Poem is written with historical abuse of power in mind, it talks of real figures from Caribbean history who has stood against slavery and European colonisation.

# Human power is temporary

## Ozymandias

_Ozymandias_ is a ruler who abused his power. "_sneer of cold command_" shows this, also in how he arrogantly tells other rulers to look at his works and "despair".

The focus on how his power is temporary is a key idea in the poem. Once his power is gone there is nothing left of his "_works_" and his statue his collapsed.

The writer uses irony to show the contrast between his belief of the power he had, and the reality that all his achievements are insignificant compared to the "_boundless_" desert.

## Tissue

Paper is used to show human power. The receipts can "_fly our lives like paper kites_", but they are fragile and easily destroyed just like the impermanence of human power.

The maps show "_borderlines_" and other man-made features, however the sun "_shines through_" suggesting, that the power of nature will always be stronger then human power.

In stanza eight we the speaker talks about letting "_daylight break_ ... _through capitals and monoliths_". This is an image of the power of nature being stronger than human power.

The "_capitals and monoliths_" represent governments and buildings all of which are temporary compared to nature
