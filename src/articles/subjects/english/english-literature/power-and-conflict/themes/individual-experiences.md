# Overview

- Conflicts can involve thousands of people, however everyone involved will have a different experience.
- Focusing on one person's experience allows the poet to present a place, action or event from a unique point of view.

# Conflict can leave people feeling isolated

## Bayonet Charge

There are no other soldiers in the poem, suggesting the soldier is isolated and alone.

The only other living thing is a "_yellow hare_" that crawls "_in a threshing circle_". Showing only one animal further shows the soldier's isolation and emphasise how far he is from any help or comfort.

The soldier feels he is insignificant in the "_cold clockwork of the stars and the nations_". He understands he is part of a wider picture however he feels completely isolated from it.

## War Photographer

The photographer is described as being "_finally alone_" which suggests that he needs space and quiet to reflect on what he has experienced, but also his guilt about being able to escape the "_suffering_".

His isolation in the war zone is enlarged by the face that it's a "_strangers features_" he photographs, and how he seeks approval "_without words_", despite the fact he is recording peoples suffering he does not share in it, which ultimately distances him from it.

The quote "_they do not care_" highlights how different he feels from everyone else, the elusiveness of who "_they_" are hints that he feels isolated from the rest of the world.

# Individuals have unique experiences of places

## London

The use of "_I_" at the start of the poem is dramatic monologue describing a walk in London.

The speaker appears to be isolated from the suffering he seems, which allows him to observe and comment on the bigger picture. This allows him to recognise the "_mind-forged manacles_" that trap people.

The speaker's description of the city is entirely negative, which makes the reader question whether he's biased. Even when he experiences the joys of a wedding he can only see a funeral "_the marriage hearse_".

## The Prelude

The narrator is alone in his "_act of stealth_" as he steals the boat, when the mountain frightens him, he describes it in personal terms, claiming the mountain "_strode after me_". This personification suggests that he feels nature is reacting to him as a individual.

He describes the effect the event on him as "_solitude_ ... _or blank desertion_", showing how the event has left him isolated and alone.

His ideas on nature have also been changed he is left feeling insignificant compared with the "_huge and might forms_" of nature.
