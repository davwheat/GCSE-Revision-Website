  - **Audience** (who you're writing to)
  - **Form** (what type of writing is it)
  - **Tone** (almost always formal)
- Use '**hamburger paragraphs**'
- **PLAN YOUR ANSWER**
  - Make sure to **draw a line under** it and **cross it out** so it isn't marked
- Use a **counter argument** (except in a leaflet)
- Write down your **timings** (5/35/5)
  - Then actually **stick to them**!
- Use **techniques**, but use them _wisely_
  - Examiners _don't like statistics_ because they're _fake_

## Question 5

You are advised to spend about **45 minutes** on this question, including **5 minutes** for **planning**, and another **5 minutes** for **proofreading** your work.

Dear Prime Minister,

This paragraph is your introductory paragraph, where you set up your point of view, overall argument, and give a brief overview of what your letter is about.

This is a body paragraph. Try to use the "hamburger sandwich" here: start with your main idea. Follow on with some evidence to support your idea as well as some development of your point. Finish up with a concluding sentence where you link back to your main idea.

This is a body paragraph. If possible, make this a conter-argument. Remember that you **must refute a counter-argument**, otherwise it is not persusive.

Finish off your letter with a conclusion, where you restate your overall argument and summarise your letter. It is also highly recommended to include a **call-to-action** where you state what you want the person you're writing to to do.

Yours Faithfully,<br/>
John Smith

_Then have a super cool strapline where you include a summary of your article in a few sentences. You should state your main points of each paragraph but not in a super obvious "listy" way._

Now start your **introduction**. Try to include: _who_, _what_, _when_, _where_, and _why_. This gives the reader a sense of knowledge when reading your article. It's key to setting up what your article is all about.
