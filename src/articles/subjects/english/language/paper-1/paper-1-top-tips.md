# Section A

**Section A** is all about **reading**. You will be given one fiction source which you then have to answer 4 questions about.

You should spend about **15 minutes** reading the questions and source. You may find it easier reading the questions first, then the source, so you know what sort of things you should annotate for.

## Overall Top Tips

- Make sure you actually answer the question!
  - Annotate what it is **actually** asking you to do!
- Write **chronologically**
  - It's easier for the examiner to follow your response
- **Stick to the timings**
  - Don't get left in the dust by spending 15 minutes on Question 1.
  - If you start running behind, stop and move on. You can always come back to a question.
- Make **multiple inferences** (Q2, Q3, Q4)
  - This bumps you up the mark scheme as you are being _perceptive_
  - Use phrases like: _perhaps_, _maybe_, _it could also mean_, _on one hand_, _possibly_
- **Box. The. Source.**
  - You **won't get marks** for any writing that **refers to content outside the part of the line numbers** the question gives you
  - If you _really need_ to reference a part outside the line numbers given, be **very quick** and **move straight on**
- Keep your **quotes consistent** (don't mix "double" and 'single')

## Question 1

You are advised to spend about **5 minutes** on this question. It is worth **4 marks**.

- **Box up** the section of the extract shown on the question
- Make sure to only give **explicit details**
- **Quote** directly from the text
- **Only list four things**! If you list more, only the first four answers will be considered.

## Question 2

You are advised to spend about **10 minutes** on this question. It is worth **8 marks**. This question is all about **language**.

- Use the **extract in the box printed** on the question paper
- Use the **SQUIDE** paragraph method
  - Statement - your overall idea
  - Quotation - reference(s) that supports your idea
  - Inference - how the reference shows your idea
  - Device - what device the reference uses (or a close word analysis of the reference)
  - Effect - the effect the idea, reference, and device have on the reader
- Performing a **close word analysis** is _just as effective_ as noticing a fancy technique
- You **must comment on the effect on the reader** for your response to be graded as Level 2 or above
- Aim for _2-3 paragraphs_: **quality over quantity**

## Question 3

You are advised to spend about **10 minutes** on this question. It is worth **8 marks**. This question is all about **structure**.

- Use the **whole source**
- Annotate structural things that **interest you**
- Try to include an overall comment about structure at the start of your answer
  - If you can't, _don't worry_. Just head straight for the body paragraphs. You can always come back to it later.
- You **must talk about the focus**, where it moves, and why
- Use the **Where? What? Why?** paragraph method:
  - **Where** is the device in the text? (e.g. beginning, middle, end)
  - **What** is the device? (e.g focus, spotlight, prolepsis, flashback, flash-forward, cyclical structure)
  - **Why** has the writer used this? (e.g. effect on reader)
- _**Do not analyse or mention language!**_ You won't get **any** marks for it.
- Aim for _3 paragraphs_: one each for the **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**
  - If you're running out of time, just go for 2 paragraphs: **beginning** and **end**

## Question 4

You are advised to spend about **20 minutes** on this question. It is worth **20 marks**. This question is all about **evaluating the use of language _and_ structure**.

- **Box up** the part of the source you need to look at
- You may wish to spend a few minutes **planning a response**
- Write in **chronological order**
- **Agree**: it's easier
  - _"The student is correct to think that..._
- **Link** the **effect on the reader** to your **evaluation**
- Use **synonyms**
  - If the statement says _"a darker and more chilling tone"_, don't just repeat _darker_ or _chilling_: use other words like _devastating_, _cataclysmic_, _brooding_, _mysterious_, _foreboding_.

# Section B (QUestion 5)

You are advised to spend about **45 minutes** on this question. It is worth **40 marks**. This question is all about **your ability to produce creative writing**.

1. **Decide which task you will do**
   1. You can be given a choice between a narrative and descriptive task, or you could be given two narrative, or two descriptive.
   2. You will always have a photo if there is a descriptive task.
   3. Write down your first ideas about the photo. Even if you don't decide to do the descriptive, you can get some great ideas for your narrative.
   4. Both tasks (narrative and descriptive) are _marked using the same mark scheme_. You can use elements of both in either task and you **will not** be penalised.
2. **Plan your response**
   1. There are a range of ways you can plan your response: box planning, grid planning, 4 quarters, _"narrative rollercoaster"_.
   2. Think about your **structure**: _in medias res_ (start at climax, then flash back); _chronological_; _cyclical_ (start at end, then flash back to start).
   3. **Check the question**: do you have to write an opening, short story, or is it up to you?
   4. Don't use more than three characters. It will get complicated quickly.
   5. **Sketch** out your characters, if it helps!
   6. Use **people you know**! The examiner won't know.
   7. Give each character a **unique characteristic**
      1. **skills**
         1. _computer skills_
         2. _utter genius because they used an amazing revision site_
      2. **personality**
         1. _eats fish fingers and custard_
         2. _shy_
         3. _sarcastic_
      3. **physical attribute or description**
         1. _wears vintage Adidas trainers_
         2. _never seen without a top hat_
3. **Write**
   1. You can frame your descriptive writing inside a narrative and vice versa
   2. Set the structure and tone from the start
   3. Remember to describe your setting and characters
   4. Mix up your sentence structure and paragraphs
      5. Start with an adverb
      6. Use a fragment sentence
      7. Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences
      8. Use embedded clauses

## Don't forget!

Remember these writing rules!

- New speaker, new line
- Draw a line under your plan and cross it out so it isn't marked
- Actually plan (And go back to it!)
- Keep your quotes consistent (don't mix "double" and 'single')
