# She is mentally disturbed

- Throughout the play, she only speaks in blank verse. However, as the the play goes on this begins to change. "Out damned spot! Out, I say!" The lack of blank verse her shows that her mental situation is deteriorating.
- She is obsessed with nightmares of her actions and finally commits suicide "Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
  perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!".

# She is dominant

- She is the main instigator of the plot to kill the king.
- Likes to be treated as an equal, which was frowned upon at the time.
- Macbeth has succumbed to her, and treats her as a equal, "my dearest partner of greatness".
- Macbeth compliments her on the fact that she uses her strength like a man - "Bring forth men-children only!" - showing that she there is nothing 'soft' or feminine about her.

# She is cunning

- Gains Duncan's trust "our honoured hostess" and "Fair and noble hostess".
- Tells Macbeth to "Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't", showing that she will do anything to get her way.

# She is an agent of the supernatural

- First she her true intentions in the opening scene, where she calls upon the "Spirits that tend on mortal thoughts" to deprive her of her feminine instinct to care.
- She is determined to make sure that the prophecy is true "Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be / What thou art promised."
- She calls on the spirits just as the witches did "unsex me here". She also goes on to ask spirits to take away all her natural feelings, and instead fill her full of "direst cruelty". She asks them to stop up the "passage of remorse" and to replace her milk with 'gall'.
- Malcom's final judgement is that Lady Macbeth was like a devil - "fiend-like queen".
- Invokes the powers of evil to help her influence her husband to commit murder and treason.
- Raises the question about Shakespeare's ideas on the supernatural.
