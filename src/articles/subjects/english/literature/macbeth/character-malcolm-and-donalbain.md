They are Duncan's sons. Malcolm is the eldest, and is therefore heir to the throne after Duncan died. This means that he should be the next King of Scotland, not Macbeth.

# They learn from their father's mistakes

- Malcolm is fair and honest, like his father. However, unlike Duncan, Malcolm and Donalbain are aware that they're in danger from those closest to them: "There's daggers in men's smiles, the near'r in blood / The nearer the bloody" They have common sense to flee Scotland after Duncan is murdered.
- Malcolm learns that he should only trust people who have proved their loyalty - when Macduff visits him, Malcolm tests his loyalty by pretending to be a tyrant. He knows that even people who see good can be evil - "all things foul would wear the brows of grace".
- In the end, Malcolm and Macduff make a good partnership because Macduff's experience gives Malcolm the confidence to take action.

# Malcolm and Donalbain aren't impulsive

- They don't react instantly to their father's murder. Malcolm says their sorrow is too "strong" to act immediately. It shows he's sensible unlike Macbeth.

# Malcolm develops to be a good leader

- He becomes confident, and earns the trust of the Scottish thanes, who say they will "give obedience where 'tis truly owed". They follow Malcolm because he's the rightful King.
- He proves he's clever when he returns to Scotland by hiding the soldiers with trees. He leads them to victory, proving he is a strong leader.
- He rewards everyone who fought with him, like Duncan he's generous.
