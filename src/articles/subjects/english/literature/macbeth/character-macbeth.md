# He is ambitious but easily led astray

- He is ambitious: "I have no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition"
- He is brave: "brave Macbeth - well he deserves that name"
- He is guilty: "Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood / Clean from my hand?"
- The way Macbeth speaks reflects his state of mind. He asks lots of questions when he's feeling uncertain or guilty: "Whence is that knocking? / How is't with me, when every noise appals me?".
- At the start and end of the play he is more certain and confident: "Stars, hide you fires", "I will not yield".

# He is a brave hero

- At the start he is described as a "valiant" warrior. Ross compares him to "Bellona's bridegroom" - a comparison to the God of War (Mars).
- He impresses the King and shows his loyalty. Macbeth is most comfortable on the battlefield where he doesn't have to worry about his guilty conscience or morality of his actions.

# He is a brutal murderer

- He is a brutal murderer. "I am settled and bend up / Each corporal agent to this terrible feat". He kills Duncan, the Macduffs and Banquo.

# He struggles with his conscience

- Macbeth struggles with his conscience. He has a strong sense of right and wrong. He worries about the consequences of his actions yet still does many of them which makes them even more shocking to the audience.
- After he kills Duncan, his guilty conscience makes him imagine things: "Macbeth does murder sleep". Then he sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet.
- By the end of the play he seams world-weary and cynical - he no longer feels guilty because he feels his actions don't matter and that life means "nothing".

# He is easily influenced

- He is easily influenced: Macbeth does what Lady Macbeth wants because he doesn't want to be seen as a "coward" and to be "more the man". Links to masculinity, strength and courage themes.
- He is also influenced by the super-natural. The first time he meets the Witches he trusts them first time, saying "Two truths are told". He sees the dagger that leads him to kill Duncan. When the prophecies come true he relies on the witches even more.
