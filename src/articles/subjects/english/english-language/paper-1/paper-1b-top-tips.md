# Section B (Question 5)

You are advised to spend about **45 minutes** on this question. It is worth **40 marks**. This question is all about **your ability to produce creative writing**.

1. **Decide which task you will do**
   1. You can be given a choice between a narrative and descriptive task, or you could be given two narrative, or two descriptive.
   2. You will always have a photo if there is a descriptive task.
   3. Write down your first ideas about the photo. Even if you don't decide to do the descriptive, you can get some great ideas for your narrative.
   4. Both tasks (narrative and descriptive) are _marked using the same mark scheme_. You can use elements of both in either task and you **will not** be penalised.
2. **Plan your response**
   1. There are a range of ways you can plan your response: box planning, grid planning, 4 quarters, _"narrative rollercoaster"_.
   2. Think about your **structure**: _in medias res_ (start at climax, then flash back); _chronological_; _cyclical_ (start at end, then flash back to start).
   3. **Check the question**: do you have to write an opening, short story, or is it up to you?
   4. Don't use more than three characters. It will get complicated quickly.
   5. **Sketch** out your characters, if it helps!
   6. Use **people you know**! The examiner won't know.
   7. Give each character a **unique characteristic**
      1. **skills**
         1. _computer skills_
         2. _utter genius because they used an amazing revision site_
      2. **personality**
         1. _eats fish fingers and custard_
         2. _shy_
         3. _sarcastic_
      3. **physical attribute or description**
         1. _wears vintage Adidas trainers_
         2. _never seen without a top hat_
3. **Write**
   1. You can frame your descriptive writing inside a narrative and vice versa
   2. Set the structure and tone from the start
   3. Remember to describe your setting and characters
   4. Mix up your sentence structure and paragraphs
      5. Start with an adverb
      6. Use a fragment sentence
      7. Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences
      8. Use embedded clauses

## Don't forget!

Remember these writing rules!

- New speaker, new line
- Draw a line under your plan and cross it out so it isn't marked
- Actually plan (And go back to it!)
- Keep your quotes consistent (don't mix "double" and 'single')
