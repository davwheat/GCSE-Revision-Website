On your non-calculator GCSE paper, you could be asked to calculate the side length of a right angled triangle with an angle of $30$, $45$, $60$ or $90$ degrees, so you have to make sure that you know the corresponding $\sin$, $\cos$ and $\tan$ values of these angles.

# How to remember

There are two main ways to memorise these values (obviously you can still come up with methods of your own).

## The MEGA FRACTION

$$
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\frac{\begin{array}{c}
\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{ }{\small 0\degree\text{  }\text{ }30\degree\text{ }45\degree\text{ }60\degree\text{ }90\degree}\\
\begin{matrix}\sin\\\cos\end{matrix}\sqrt{\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}}\\
\end{array}}{2}
$$

This seems complicated at first, but the explanation will help.

### Cslculating values of sin/cos

To work out the value of $\sin45$, you would look at the top row of the **MEGA FRACTION**, as that is labelled $\sin$.

$$
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\frac{\begin{array}{c}
\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{  }\text{ }{\small 0\degree\text{  }\text{ }30\degree\text{ }45\degree\text{ }60\degree\text{ }90\degree}\\
\sqrt{\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\end{array}}\\
\end{array}}{2}
$$

You will then look at the number under $45\degree$, which is $2$.

You then remove all the other numbers to get $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so now you know that $\sin45=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

### Cslculating values of tan
