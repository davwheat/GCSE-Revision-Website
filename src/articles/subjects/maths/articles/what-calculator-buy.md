There are many different types and brands of scientific calulcators on the market (.com) that you can buy. Some you can't use for GCSE or A-Level due to rules set in place by the **Joint Council for Qualifications** (JCQ).

All of the information below has been taken from Section 10 of JCQ's _Instructions for conducting examinations_ PDF document for 2019-2020. **Please double-check that these rules still apply in the future.** You can find this document on [JCQ's website](http://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations).

# Calculator rules

These are the basic rules you must be aware of:

- If the question paper does not state that you cannot use a calculator, calculators should be treated as standard equipment and may be used in that examination.
- Students are responsible for ensuring that their calculators meet their awarding bodies' regulations.
- Invigilators may give candidates a replacement calculator.
- Students may **not** borrow one anothers' calculators during an examination.

## In detail...

According to Section 10.3, your calculator must...

- be of a size suitable for use on the desk;
- be either battery or solar powered;
- be free of lids, cases, and covers which have printed instructions or formulas.

The candidate is responsible for...

- the calculator's power supply (ensure it has enough battery);
- the calculator's working condition (make sure it turns on);
- clearing anything stored in the calculator (formulae, variables, etc).

Furthermore, calculators to be used in exams may not...

- have: language translators; **symbolic** algebraic manipulation; **symbolic** differentiation or integration; communications technology with other machines or the internet
- be borrowed from another candidate during an examination for any reason
- have retrievable information stored in them, such as: databanks; dictionaries; mathematical formulas; or text.

# Calculators that meet the regulations

There are many calculators that meet all of these regulations, but here are a subset of them:

# The best calculator

In my opinion, the best calculator is the fx-991 EX as it provides you with a massive advantage over other students.

![CASIO Classwiz fx-991 EX](articles/fx-991ex.png)

The fx-991 EX (991, for short) offers many features, including the ability to: solve quadratic equations, solve simultaneous equations, differentiate, integrate, solve equations (e.g. $2x + 5 = 15 \\times x$), solve matrix calculations, solve quadratic inequalities, calculator the equation of a line (using a calculator 'hack'), generate QR codes to scan with a phone to view graphs and explain how to solve problems you enter into it, and much more.

Some people do say, however, that it is unsuitable for GCSEs due to the fact it has differentiation and integration. This is not true. The regulations state that the calculator must not have **symbolic** differentiation and integration, which the 991 does not. It is possible that your school may not allow you to have this as they believe it is against the regulations.

If you want to buy this calculator, I highly recommend contacting your school's exams officer, presenting the evidence that this calculator is allowed according to the JCQ _Instructions for completing examinations_ document so that they are aware that the calculator is allowed.

When contacting my school's exams officer, I received this response:

> Hi &lt;name>,
>
> Firstly well done for doing your research. As you can appreciate there are so many different calculators on the market it is impossible to maintain a list of those calculators that are/aren’t allowed in exams. The key is to check the JCQ regulations which you have done. As long as your calculator does not offer any of the following facilities...
>
> · language translators
> · symbolic algebra manipulation
> · symbolic differentiation or integration
> · communication with other machines or the internet
>
> ... and does not have retrievable information stored within it then it will be acceptable for use in an exam.
>
> Like you, I have researched the Casio FX-991EX online and have found no reliable evidence to show that it would not be acceptable in an exam and am therefore more than happy for it to be used for your maths GCSE exams.
