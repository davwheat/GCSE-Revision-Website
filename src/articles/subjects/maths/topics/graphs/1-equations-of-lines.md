You should never trust a maths teacher with graph paper: they're probably plotting something.

# The Line Equations

If there's one thing you should remember from reading this it should be the linear line equation. This can be used to represent **any straight line** on a graph.

$$y=mx+c$$

## What the hell do those letters mean

$m$ is used to represent the gradient of the lines (how steep it is).

$c$ is the y-intercept of the line - where the line crossed across the y axis.

### Examples

<ExamQuestion questionNumber={1} question="State the gradient of the line $y=2x+3$." marks={1} />

**Question 1:** State the gradient of the line $y=2x+3$.
