Calculators are a crucial part of your GCSE Maths, with two of the three exams requiring one. Why not make the most of them by learning about these cool tips and ticks to speed up your calculations?

This guide is aimed towards the Casio Classwiz fx-991 EX but will also work for most other Casio scientific calculators, such as the extremely common fx-83GT PLUS or fx-85GT PLUS.

If the steps for any of these tips differs between these two calculators, both methods will be shown.

# 1. Product of prime factors

Your calculator can tell you any integer's prime factors. This can also be used to check if a number is prime or not.

**_fx-83GT PLUS_ and _fx-991EX_:**

1. Type in the number (e.g. **`25`**).
2. Press the equals **`=`** button.
3. Press **`SHIFT`**, then press the degrees (**`°′ ″`**) button, labelled **`FACT`** in yellow.
4. The prime factor is shown on the display, in this example, $5^2$.
5. If it still shows the same number, then it is prime.

# 2. Easy Pythagoras and Trig

Sometimes, it just requires that little bit too much effort to write out a whole Pythagoras equation in your calculator just to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, such as:

$$
5=\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}
$$

It's also quite tricky to remember the whole [SOH CAH TOA song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWJo5uK3Fo) just for calculating one angle.

**Don't fret!** I have one super easy way to find out the length of the hypotenuse and the angle you need.

**_fx-83GT PLUS_ and _fx-991EX_:**

1.  Press **`SHIFT`** + `+` (labelled `Pol` in yellow).
2.  Enter the length of the **adjacent** side. In our example, `7`.
3.  Press **`SHIFT`** + `)` (labelled `,` in yellow).
4.  Enter the length of the **opposite** side. In our example, `3`.
5.  Close the function with the `)` button, then press `=`.
6.  The answer is displayed: $r=\text{hypotenuse length}, \theta=\text{angle size}$
7.  In our example, $r=7.615...,\text{ }\theta=23.198...$

# 3. 1-button reciprocals

Calculating reciprocals is on almost every GCSE maths paper and it can be quickly done with a calculator.

**Example question:**

$$
\text{Find the reciprocal of 1.6}\\
\text{Give your answer as a decimal.}
$$

**_fx-83GT PLUS_ and _fx-991EX_:**

1.  Type in your number (e.g. `1.6`)
2.  Press the reciprocal button ($x^{-1}$), followed by `=`
3.  As this question requires a decimal, press `S⬄D` to get $0.625$

# 4. n-th term tables and graph coordinates

Calculating values for an $n^{\text{th}}$ term table can take upwards of 5 minutes if you have to substitute the value for $x$ every time. What many people don't realise is that most scientific calculators have a way to do this for you.

**Example:**

$$
\text{Complete the table for values of: } y=2x^2-3x+4
$$

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
|   $x$    |   $-1$   |   $0$    |   $1$    |   $2$    |   $3$    |   $4$    |
|   $y$    |          |          |   $3$    |          |          |   $24$   |

**_fx-83GT PLUS_:**

1.  Press **`MODE`** at the top of your calculator.
2.  Press **`3`** to choose `TABLE` mode.
3.  Enter your equation: $2x^2-3x+4$. If you are calulating $n^{\text{th}}$ term, replace $n$ with $x$.
4.  Press `=`
5.  Enter your start value, then press `=` (ours is $-1$ as that is the lowest value of $x$).
6.  Enter your end value, then press `=` (ours is $4$ as that is the highest value of $x$).
7.  Enter the step value, then press `=` (ours is $1$ as the values of $x$ increase by $1$ each time)
8.  The table then shows the value of $x$ and $y$ (shown as $f(x)$).

**_fx-991EX_:**

1.  Press **`MENU`** at the top of your calculator.
2.  Press **`9`** to choose `TABLE` mode.
3.  Enter your equation: $2x^2-3x+4$. If you are calulating $n^{\text{th}}$ term, replace $n$ with $x$.
4.  Press `=`
5.  If prompted with $g(x)$, press `=`. Don't enter anything.
6.  Enter your start value, then press `=` (ours is $-1$ as that is the lowest value of $x$).
7.  Enter your end value, then press `=` (ours is $4$ as that is the highest value of $x$).
8.  Enter the step value, then press `=` (ours is $1$ as the values of $x$ increase by $1$ each time)
9.  The table then shows the value of $x$ and $y$ (shown as $f(x)$).
