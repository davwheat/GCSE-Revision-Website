# What is an atom?

Every substance is made up of small particles called **atoms**. Atoms are roughly **1 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m (0.1 nanometers) in radius** - pretty small!

The atom has had (and still has!) many different models which have advanced as time passed and technology improved. Modern scientists have created a few different modern models of the atom, but the one you'll learn is the most well-liked of them all so far.

# An atom's make up

There are a few different parts which all come together to make what we know as an atom. You have the **nucleus** and the **electrons**.

## The nucleus

- It is in the **middle** of the atom
- It is made up of **protons** and **neutrons**
- It has a radius of about 1 × 10<sup>-14</sup> m ($\frac{1}{10000}$ of the radius of an atom)
- Most of the atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus

## The electrons

- They **orbit** around the nucleus in **shells**
- They are **negatively charged** and **tiny**
- The shells take up most of the space in an atom
- The **volume** of their orbits determines the size of the atom
- They have **negligible** (almost no) **mass**

# Charges and masses

Each particle has a different mass and charge

| Particle | Relative mass  | Relative charge |
| :------: | :------------: | :-------------: |
|  Proton  |       1        |       +1        |
| Neutron  |       1        |        0        |
| Electron | 0 (neglibible) |       -1        |

> Protons are **heavy** and **positively charged**.
>
> Neutrons are **heavy** and **neutral** (not charged).
>
> Electrons are **tiny** and **negatively charged**.

## Number of Protons = Number of Electrons

Atoms are **neutral** because they have **no overall charge**, unlike ions, because they have an **equal number of protons and electrons**. Electron charges are the same size as proton charges, just **opposite**, so each charge **cancels out**.

> An ion is an atom, or group of atoms, that has gained or lost an electron.

In an **ion**, the number of protons and electrons are _not_ equal, meaning it _has_ an **overall charge**. For example, an ion with a charge of `2-` has **two more electrons than protons**.

# Atomic Number & Mass Number

The **nuclear symbol** (an element's "box" on the periodic table) tells you an atom's **atomic (proton) number** and its **mass number**.

The **atomic number** tells you how many **protons** are in the nucleus of the atom. It is also known as the **proton number**.

The **mass number** of an atom tells you the total number of protons and neutrons added together.

To calculate the **number of neutrons**, subtract the **atomic number** from the **mass number**.
