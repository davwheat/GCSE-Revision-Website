# Early 19th Century - "Solid Sphere" Model

At the start of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, **John Dalton** described atoms as **solid spheres**, and said that different spheres made up the **different elements**. He demonstrated this using his five atomic balls (don't laugh), pictured below.

# Late 19th Century - The Plum Pudding Model

In 1897, J. J. Thompson concluded that atoms were **not**, in fact, solid spheres. His experiments led him to discover measurements of **charge** and **mass**, meaning that atoms must have even smaller, negatively charged particles - electrons.

Thompson named the new theory the _"plum pudding model"_. The model shows the atom as a **positively charged ball** with **negatively charged electrons inside** it.

# Early 20th Century - Ernest Rutherford & Ernest Marsden

## Alpha Particle Scattering

In 1909, Ernest **Rutherford** and his student Ernest **Marsden** conducted the **alpha particle scattering experiments**. They, together, fired **positively charged particles** at an extremely thin sheet of gold.

Following the plum pudding model, they **expected** the particles to **go straight through** the sheet of gold, or possibly be slightly deflected. This was because the **positive** charge of the atom was thought to be **spread out** across the entirety of the atom.

However, despite **most** of the particles passing straight through the atoms, some were **deflected significantly more** than expected and others **bounced directly back** at them, meaning that the plum pudding model was not correct.

## Rutherford's Model

In response, Rutherford came up with a new theory for the atom: the **nuclear model**. In this model, there is a **tiny, positively charged nucleus** at the **centre**, where the atom's mass is concentrated.

A "cloud" of negatively charged electrons surround the nucleus: most of the atom is **empty space**.

When the alpha particles came near the concentrated, positive charge of the nucleus, they were **deflected**. If they were fired **directly at the nucleus**, they were **deflected backwards**. Otherwise, they passed through the empty space.

# Early 20th Century - Bohr's Nuclear Model

There was one hole in Rutherford's research: if the electrons were in a "cloud" around the nucleus, the differing charges would eventually cause the atom to **collapse** in on itself, as the electrons get attracted to the nucleus.

Niels Bohr filled this gap by suggesting that all electrons were contained in **shells**. He proposed that the electrons **orbit** the nucleus in **fixed shells** and aren't anywhere in between: the shells are at fixed distances from the nucleus. Bohr's model was supported by many further experiments, and helped to explain many other scientists' observations at the time.
