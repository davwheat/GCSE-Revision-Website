# What is an element?

An element is a substance made up of **atoms** that all have the **same** number of **protons** in their **nucleus**.

# Elements are made up of atoms with the same atomic number

Atoms can have differing numbers of electrons, protons and neutrons. The **number of protons** in an atom determines what **type** of atom it is.

> For example, an atom which has **one** proton in its nucleus would be a **Hydrogen** atom. An atom with **two** protons would be a **Helium** atom.

If a substance contains **only atoms with the same number of protons** (of the same type), it's called an **element**. All atoms of a particular **element** have the **same** number of protons. No two elements have the same number of protons in their atoms.

There are 118 elements as of 2019 and each element consists of only one type of atom.

# Element symbols

Atoms of each element can be respresented by a symbol made from letters. It's a shorthand way of writing the element name which saves you form writing out the full name.

Some element symbols make perfect sense, such as Oxygen (O), Carbon (C), or Helium (He), but some make less sense, such as Sodium (Na), Lead (Pb) or Mercury (Hg). These symbols (along with the name of the element, its atomic number and mass number) are shown on the **periodic table**, which you'll get a copy of for both of your exams.

You can find a copy of the periodic table you'll get during your exams on the AQA website, [download it off of our website](/files/periodic-table-insert.pdf), or see a copy of it in every chemistry article on our site.
