Titrations are a method of analysing the concentrations of solutions: they're _prettttyyyy_ important!

# Use

Titrations are used to work out exactly what volume of an acid is required to neutralise a base, or vice versa. This info can then be used to calculate the concentration of the acid or alkali.

# Method

In this method, we'll be calculating the concentration of an **alkali**. If you wanted to do this for an acid, just swap "alkali" and "acid" around in the method.

## Equipment

- Burette
- Pipette
- Funnel
- Filter Paper
- Conical Flask
- Boss, Clamp, and Stand
- Single Indicator

## Instructions

1. Add a set volume of the alkali (5cm<sup>3</sup>, for example) to a conical flask. Add a few drops of indicator.
2. Fill the burette up with an acid of **known concentration** using a funnel -- record the starting volume in the burette. Do this from above so you don't burn your eyes to smithereens if any acid spills.
3. Use the burette to add the acid to the alkali, giving the conical flask a swirl regularly. Go especially slowly if you believe the end-point (colour change) is about to be reached.
4. The indicator will change colour when all the alkali has been neutralised. (e.g. phenolphtalein is pink in alkaline conditions, but colourless in acidic conditions).
5. Record the final volume in the burette.
6. Use the final and initial volumes to calculate the volume of acid used to neutralise the alkali.

## Repeat and Find Averages

You should **repeat titrations** to increase the **accuracy** of your readings and find the **average volume** of the acid required to **neutralise** the alkali, as well as to **spot any anomalous results**.

On the **first** titration, you usually perform a **rough** titration to find an approximate volume of acid required. Afterwards, you become **more and more accurate** as you get a better idea of the amount of acid required to neutralise the alkali. You should get the **same result** each time (within about 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup>).

## Use Single Indicators for Titrations

Universal Indicator (UI) is used to **estimate** the pH of solutions because it can turn a variety of colours and no two batches are identical. Each colour indicates a narrow range of pH values.

UI is made from a **mixture** of **different indicators**. The colour gradually changes from red in acidic solutions to purple/indigo in alkaline solutions.

During a titration, you want to see a **sudden colour change** at the end-point (where all the substance has been neutralised), so you should use a single indicator such as:

- phenolphthalein (**colourless** in acid; <span style="color:#ff7fe7">**pink**</span> in alkalis)
- litmus (<span style="color:#ff4a4a">**red**</span> in acid; <span style="color:#2e97ff">**blue**</span> in alkalis)
- methyl orange (<span style="color:#ff4a4a">**red**</span> in acid; <span style="color:yellow">**yellow**</span> in alkalis)
