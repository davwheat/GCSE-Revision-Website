**Acids** and **bases** crop up everywhere in chemistry - here's the basics about **pH levels**.

# The pH Scale

pH is a measurement of the **acidity** of a solution. The scale ranges from **0 to 14**, with **0** being **extremely acidic**, **14** being **extremely alkaline**, and **7** being **neutral**.

# Measuring pH

There are two main ways that pH is **measured**: through **indicators**, or with **electronic probes**. Here's the low-down.

## Indicators

An **indicator** (not like the ones on a car) is a **dye** that **changes colour** depending on whether the substance is **above** or **below a certain pH**.

Some indicators, like **Universal Indicator** (which give the colours shown above), contain a mixture of dyes, making them **gradually** change colour over a **broad range of pH levels**. These are named wide range indicators and are useful for estimating the pH of solutions.

## pH Probes & Meters

A **pH probe** attached to a **pH meter** is the **most accurate** method of measuring pH levels of solutions. The probe is placed in the solution you wish to measure and the pH is given on a digital display as a **numerical value**.

# Neutralisation Acids and Bases

- An **acid** is any substance that forms an **aqueous** (dissolved into water) **solution** with a pH of **less than 7**.
- A **base** is any substance that **reacts** with an **acid** to form a **neutral salt** (pH 7).
- An **alkali** is a base that **dissolves** in water to form a **solution** with a pH of **greater than 7**. Alkalis form $\text{OH}^-$ ions in water.

The reaction between an acid and a base is called **neutralisation**:

$$
\text{acid} + \text{base} \to \text{salt} + \text{water}
$$

**Neutralisation** between acids and alkalis can be seen in terms of $\text{H}^+$ and $\text{OH}^-$ **ions**, like this:

$$
\text{H}^+_\text{(aq)} + \text{OH}^-_\text{(aq)} \to \text{H}_2\text{O}_\text{(l)}
$$

_**Hydrogen ions react with hydroxide ions to form water, a neutral molecule.**_

When an acid neutralises a base (or vice versa), the **products** are **neutral**. An indicator (or pH probe) can be used to show that a neutralisation reaction is over.
