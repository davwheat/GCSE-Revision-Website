DNA is made up of four different bases: A, T, C, and G. **A will always pair up with T** and **C will always pair up with G**.

# What does DNA look like?

<br />

 - DNA is found in a **double helix shape** (like a twisted ladder).
 - The edges of the double helix are made from **ribose sugar**. 
 - There are two halves to DNA: the **coding strand**, and the **complimentary strand**.
   - The coding strand is the actual DNA coding (the information that is read and actually used).
   - The complimentary strand purely exists to provide support to the coding strand and make the DNA polymer more stable.

# The Bases

You don't have to remember the names of A, T, C, and G, but you do have to know which base goes with which.

**A always matches with T. C always matches with G.**

The only reason you never find C-T or A-G pairs is because of the physical shape differences which prevent them connecting together.

# Making proteins (protein synthesis)

Proteins are made in the cell cytoplasm on tiny structures named **ribosomes**. To be able to make proteins, ribosomes use the code in the DNA. As DNA is found in the nucleus and is too big to fit through the gaps, **mRNA** (messenger RNA) is created.

mRNA can be thought of as 'half a stick' of DNA: instead of having the coding *and* complimentary strand, it only has **one strand**. This means it **cannot last long before breaking**: it is temporary.

1. The **coding strand** of a section of DNA is **copied** as **mRNA**.
   - When copying, the bases become the **opposite base** (e.g. G becomes C, T becomes A).
   - There are **no T's** in mRNA - they instead become **U's**. (Don't ask why!)
2. The mRNA **exits the nucleus** through a **semi-permeable membrane**.
3. The mRNA is **copied** a second time into another piece of mRNA.
4. The second copy of mRNA travels to the **ribosome** and passes through its **cleft** (small split), being scanned **like a barcode**.
   - Each three strands form a triplet codon. These codons refer to a **specific amino acid**.
5. The **amino acids** read from the mRNA are brought to the ribosomes in the **correct order** by **carrier molecules**.
6. These amino acids are put together by the ribosome to form a specific protein.

Steps 1 to 4 are shown in this diagram.

<KeyFact
    body="It's very easy to forget that T's don't exist in mRNA. When DNA is copied, the opposite base is taken (for an A, you'd expect this to be a T). Instead, a U base replaces any T bases that would have been formed."
