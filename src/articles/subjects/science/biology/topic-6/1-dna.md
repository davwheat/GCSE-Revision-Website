DNA, more simply known as deoxyribonucleic acid, is what decides what characteristics an organism has.

# Where is it?

<br/>

DNA is stored inside a cell's **nucleus** in very long strands called **chromosomes**. Humans have 46 chromosomes, stored in pairs, inside each body cell.

    body="Every living organism has DNA as every living organism needs instruction on how to 'build' itself. The instructions are different for each organism, so DNA varies between species (although not as much as you may think), otherwise we and worms would be completely identical."

# Key info about DNA

- DNA stands for <u>d</u>eoxyribo<u>n</u>ucleic <u>a</u>cid. All genetic material in a cell is made up of it.
- DNA contains **coded information** stored in **triplet codons** - this means that each group of three strands of DNA codes for a specific amino acid.
  - These codons also decide **what inherited characteristics you have**.
- DNA is a polymer: made of **two strands** in the shape of a **double helix**.
