"ARGH! GET AWAY FROM ME!" is what you'd scream if someone had a communicable disease. **Communicable diseases are just diseases that can spread.** Done!

# Types of Pathogen

Pathogens are types of microorganism that enter the body and cause disease. They can cause **communicable** (infectious - easily spread) diseases. Both animals and plants can be infected by pathogens. Pathogens can be **bacteria**, **viruses**, **protists**, or **fungi** (why thank you, yes I am!).

You need to know these four types of pathogen.

## Bacteria

- They are **very small** cells
  - About $\frac{1}{100}$ the size of your standard body cell
- They **reproduce** rapidly
- They make you feel ill by producing **toxins** that damage your cells and tissue

## Viruses

- They are **not cells**
  - They're tiny: $\frac{1}{100}$ the size of bacteria, or $\frac{1}{10 000}$ the size of a standard body cell
- They **reproduce** rapidly
- They live **inside body cells**
  - They use the **mechanisms inside the cell** to produce **copies** of themselves
- The cell will usually **fill up** with copies of the **virus**, then **burst**
- The bursting and damage to the cell is what makes you feel ill

## Protists

- There are many **different types** of protist
- They are all **eukaryotes** and most are single-celled
- Some are parasites
  - Parasites live on or inside other organisms and can cause damage
  - Parasites are usually transferred to the organism via a **vector** which doesn't get the disease itself
    - e.g. an insect (the _vector_) carries the protist

## Fungi

Oh, stop it! I'm blushing!

- Some are **single-celled**
- Others have a body made up of **hyphae**
- Hyphae are thread-like structures that grow and penetrate human skin and plant surfaces, causing disease
- Hyphae can produce spores which spread the fungi to other plants and animals

# Spreading of Pathogens

Pathogens are usually spread in one of three ways: water, air, and direct contact.

## Water

Some pathogens can be spread by drinking or bathing in **dirty water**. For example, _cholera_ is a _bacterial infection_ spread by drinking _contaminated water_.

## Air

Some pathogens can be transported through the air and **breathed in**. This includes the _common cold_ and _influenza_, which is carried through the air in droplets produced when your cough or sneeze.

## Direct Contact

Some pathogens can be picked up by touching contaminated surfaces, including the **skin**. For example, _athlete's foot_ is a fungal infection which makes the _skin itch and flake off_ like a well baked French croissant (don't write that in your exam, please). It's usually spread by _sharing things_ with an infected person, like _shower floors_ and _towels_.
