Antibodies aren't just used inside the immune system. _Fancy-schmancy_ scientists have engineered them for lots of other uses too, like pregnancy tests or treating diseases.

# What are they

1. **Antibodies** are produced by **B-lymphocytes**
2. **Monoclonal antibodies** are made from **lots of clones** of a single white blood cell
   1. This means that all the antibodies are **identical** and will only target **one** specific protein **antigen**
3. This allows monoclonal antibodies to be produced to attack a specific pathogen: great for curing diseases!

# How they are made

1. A mouse is injected with a **specific chosen antigen**
2. **Plasma** from the mouse's **blood** is extracted
3. **B-lymphocytes** are extracted from the **plasma**
4. The B-lymphocytes are **fused** with **tumour cells** to form a **hybridoma**
   1. This is done because lymphocytes **don't grow easily** but tumour cells do
5. The **hybridoma divides rapidly**, producing loads of B-lymphocyte clones: **the monoclonal antibodies**

# What are they used in?

_Fancy-schmancy_ scientists have engineered monoclonal antibodies for lots of different uses, such as **pregnancy tests**, **identifying substances**, or **treating diseases**.

## Pregnancy tests

A hormone called **HCG** is found only in the **urine of pregnant women**. **Pregnancy testing sticks** detect this hormone.

1. The part you **wee on** has some **HCG antibodies** attached to some **coloured beads**
2. The **test strip** (the part that goes a colour if you're pregnant) has some **more HCG antibodies**
   1. The antibodies on the test strip are **stuck down** so they **can't move**
3. If you **are pregnant**...
   1. The **hormone binds** to the **antibodies** on the **coloured beads**
   2. The wee **moves up** the stick, **carrying** the HCG and coloured beads with it
   3. The beads and hormone **bind** to the stuck antibodies on the test strip
   4. The coloured beads get stuck on the strip, turning it blue
4. If you are **not pregnant**...
   1. The wee **still** moves up the stick, carrying the coloured beads but **no HCG**
   2. Because there's **no HCG**, the beads **don't bind** to the antibodies on the **test strip** so the strip **doesn't go coloured**
