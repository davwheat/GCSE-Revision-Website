Pathogens love to just infect and infect and infect... but there are measures we can take to protect ourselves and other organisms from being infected.

# Be Hygienic

- Taking simple precautions, like **washing hands** before preparing food or after sneezing, can prevent spread of disease

# Destroying Vectors

![Nope... Still not that Vector...](articles/biology/topic-3/vector.png)

- By **killing** the **organisms** that spread disease, you can **prevent the disease spreading**
- Insect vectors can be killed with **insecticides** or **destroying their habitat** so they can't breed
  - The **spread of malaria** can be reduced by stopping **mosquitoes** from breeding

# Isolate the infected

- If you **prevent infected** from coming into **contact** with the **uninfected**, it prevents them passing the disease onto anyone else

# Vaccination

- **Vaccinating people and animals** against communicable diseases means they **can't catch the infection** and pass it on
  - For example, most UK **poultry** are given a **vaccination** against _Salmonella_, a bacteria that causes a type of food poisoning
- However, a greater proportion of parents, dubbed "antivaxxers", are refusing to immunise their children for a multitude of reasons, allowing previously eradicated diseases to return to the UK
