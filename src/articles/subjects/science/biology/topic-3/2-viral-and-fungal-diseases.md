There are loads of diseases caused by viruses and fungi, but let's just stick to four for now.

**You need to know these.**

# Measles

- Caused by **droplets** from an **infected person's sneezes or coughs**
- Many symptoms
  - **Red skin rash**
  - Signs of a **fever**
- Can be **serious**, or **fatal** if complications develop
  - For example, measles can lead to **pneumonia** (a lung infection) or **encephalitis** (a brain infection)
- Most people are **vaccinated** against measles when they are young as part of the MMR vaccine

![The MMR vaccine campaign is very prominent, especially with idiotic "anti-vaxxers" who refuse to vaccinate their children.](articles/biology/topic-3/mmr.jpg)

# HIV

- A virus spread by **sexual contact** or exchanging bodily fluids such as blood
  - For example, having **sexual intercourse**; **sharing needles** when taking drugs; or (especially in the past) having **blood transfusions** from infected donors
- Causes **flu-like symptoms for a few weeks**
- Usually the infected experience **no further symptoms for many years**, making them unaware of the infection
  - During this time, **antiretroviral** drugs can be used to prevent the virus replicating itself
- It attacks the immune cells
- If the body's immune system is badly damaged, it can't cope with other infections or cancers
  - At this stage, the virus is called _"late stage HIV"_ or _"AIDS"_

# Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)

- TMV is a **virus** that affects many species of **plants**, including **tomatoes**
- Causes a **mosaic pattern** of **discolouration** on **leaves**
  - The discoloured parts mean the plant cannot perform **photosynthesis**, preventing good growth

# Rose Black Spot

- Fungal disease that causes **purple or black spots** on the leaves of infected **rose plants**
  - These leaves turn **yellow**, then **drop off**
  - Less leaves means **less photosynthesis**, preventing good plant growth
- It spreads through the environment via **water** or **air** (the wind)
- Can be treated with **fungicides** and **stripping the plant of affected leaves** and **destroying** the leaves so it doesn't spread to other plants
