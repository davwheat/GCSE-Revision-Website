The immune system has some **sick** (hehehe) ways to fight foreign particles like viruses, bacteria, and other diseases if they enter your body. It's pretty cool!

# Defence System

The body has some remarkable ways to prevent 'nasties' getting inside in the first place.

- **Skin**
  - acts as a **barrier** to pathogens
  - secretes **antimicrobial substances** that kill pathogens
- **Nose hair and mucus**
  - trap particles that could contain pathogens
- **Trachea and bronchi**
  - secrete **mucus** which traps pathogens
  - lined with **cilia**
    - hair-like structures that **waft the mucus** (you might call it _phlegm_) up to the **back of the throat**, where it can be **swallowed**
- **Stomach**
  - produces **hydrochloric acid** ($\text{HCl}$) that **kills pathogens** that make it to the stomach

# Immune System

If pathogens make it into your body, you **immune system** fires up. The most important part of your immune system is the **white blood cells**.

- White blood cells **travel around the body** in your **blood**
- They crawl into every part of you, patrolling for **microbes**
- If they come across a microbe they have three lines of attack...

## Consuming Them

In a process called **phagocytosis**, white blood cells, called **phagocytes**, **engulf** foreign cells and **digest** them.

## Producing Antibodies and Antitoxins

**B-lymphocytes** are a type of white blood cell that produce **antibodies** for **specific pathogens**.

_Note: all of the info below also applies to antitoxins as well as antibodies!_

- Every invading pathogen has _unique_ molecules, called **antigens**, on its surface
- When **B-lymphocytes** come across a foreign antigen, a process begins
  - The white blood cells will start producing **proteins** called **antibodies**
  - The antibodies **lock onto the invading cells**
    - Antibodies are **specific** to each pathogen - they won't lock onto any others
  - Once locked on, they enable **other white blood cells** to **locate** and **destroy** them
  - Antibodies are then produced **rapidly** and carried throughout the body to find all similar bacteria or viruses
- If the person is infected with the same pathogen again, the antibodies will immediately produce the antibody again
