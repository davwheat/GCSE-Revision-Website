# Homeostasis

Definition:

> homeostasis (n.) — maintaining a stable internal environment

## The Necessity of Homeostasis

1. The conditions inside your body need to be kept steady even when the external environment changes
2. Your cells need to work conditions in order to function properly (enzymes need the right environment to function)
3. Homeostasis is the regulation of conditions inside your body and cells to maintain a stable internal environment, in response to changes in environment both internally and externally
4. Your body has many systems to regulate internal environment, including both nervous and hormonal communication systems
5. Automatic control systems components: receptors, coordination centres (including the brain, spinal cord, pancreas) and effectors

## Feedback Loops

Feedback loops are used to ensure that your body maintains a stable internal environment. For example your blood glucose level is controlled via a feedback loop.

Feedback loops are made up of three main components: **receptors**, **coordination centres**, and **effectors**.

### How feedback loops work

If a **receptor** detects that your blood glucose level is too high, it sends a message to your **coordination centre** which organises a response. The **effector** produces a response which counteracts the change and makes the level return to its optimum value.

The opposite reaction happens if your blood glucose level is too low.

The **effectors** continues producing the response as long as they are **stimulated** by the **coordination centre**. Unfortunately, this can cause the opposite problem making the level change too much from the ideal. To combar this, the **receptor detects** if the level changes too much and the **opposite** reaction starts.

This process happens without you thinking about it — it's completely automated. Clever, _huh_?

# The Nervous System

**The Nervous System** allows humans to react to their surroundings and coordinate their behaviour.

## How the Nervous System reacts

1. Living organsisms, like us, need to react to stimuli (changes in their environment) in order to remain living
2. Single-celled organisms can respond to their environment on their own but multicellular organism, like us, need to communicate with each other first
3. Multicellular organisms have evolved to develop nervous and hormonal communication systems

## The Parts of the Nervous System

### Central Nervous System

The **Central Nervous System** (CNS), in vertebrates, consists of the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the CNS is connected to the body via sensory nerves and motor nerves.

### Sensory Nerves

The **nerves** (or **neurons**) that carry information as electrical impulses from the **receptors** to the **CNS**.

### Motor Nerves

The **nerves** (or **neurons**) that carry electrical impulses from the **CNS** to **effector organs**.

### Effector Organs

_All_ muscles and glands are **effector organs**. They respond to the impulses from your **motor nerves**.

## Receptors and Effectors can form part of Complex Organs

1. **Receptors** are the cells that **detect stimuli**
2. There are many different types of receptors, such as taste receptors on the tongue and sound receptors in the ears
3. Receptors can form part of **larger, complex organs**, e.g. the retina of the eye is covered in light receptor cells
4. **Effector Organs** respond to nervous impulses and bring about a change

## Purpose of the Central Nervous System (CNS)

The CNS's purpose is to coordinate responses — it's called a **coordination centre** for a reason! It receives information from the **receptors** and coordinates a response (works out what to do about it). This response is carried out by the **effectors**.

You need to remember a couple of **Central Nervous Systems**: the **brain** and the **spinal cord**.

### Example

Imagine a toddler in the kitchen...

1. ...and they see some chocolate (the food is the **stimulus**)
2. The **receptors** in the toddler's eye are **stimulated**
3. **Sensory nerves** carry the info from the **receptors** to the **CNS** (in this case, the **brain**)
4. The **CNS** decides what to do about this information
5. The **CNS** sends information to the muscles (the **effectors**) along **motor nerves**
6. The toddler's muscles contract and they runs towards the chocolate (and their parents aren't too happy...)

## Synapses

**Synapses** are the _fancy_ name for the part of a nerve cell used to connect multiple nerves or neurons together in a chain. The cells don't actually touch, so they can't transfer an actual electrical charge. Instead they use **_CHEMICALS!!!_**

1. The **connection** between two **neurons** is called a **synapse**.
2. The nerve signal is transferred by **chemicals** that diffuse (move) across the gap between the neurons.
3. The chemicalsset off a new **electrical signal** in the next neuron.

### Neurotransmitters

You need to know two examples of neurotransmitters:

- dopamine (the 'happy' one)
- ATP (the normal one)

# Reflex actions

**Reflex actions** happen without you even thinking about it. (I'm sure we all wish revision worked this way too...) The **nerve path** that a reflex action takes is called a **reflex arc**.

They are a way for the body to automatically respond to a stimulus to minimise damage to the body. Reflexes happen so quickly because the actions only have to pass through 3 nerves. **Reflex actions** generally follow this pattern:

**stimulus** → **receptor** → **sensory nerve** → **relay nerve** → **motor nerve** → **effector** → **response**

![An example reflex arc for nearing a flame](articles/biology/homeostasis-reflex-action.png)

1. The **stimulus** is the object that triggers the reflex action (e.g. a hot pan).
2. The **receptor** is the thing in the skin that _detects_ the stimulus (e.g. a change in temperature)
3. The **sensory nerve** sends a message from the receptor to the **relay nerve** which is inside the CNS (spinal cord for reflex actions).
4. The **relay nerve** _relays_ the message from the sensory nerve, to the **motor nerve**.
5. The **motor nerve** sends impulses to the **effector**.
6. The **effector** produces a **response** (e.g. contracts muscles to move hand away from the flame).

## Confusion

Some students get confused about reflex actions and call conscious action reflexes.

### Catching a dropped ruler is a reflex

Some students, when discussing the ruler drop test for measuring reaction time, call it a reflex action. **This is incorrect.**

A reflex action must not be made consciously: it is made automatically. When your eye sees the ruler has been dropped, you _consciously_ decide to catch the ruler. It isn't automatic.

### You can't override a reflex action

Yes, you can!

When picking up a hot plate or tray (don't try it!), the reflex action will make you drop it almost immediately. However, it is possible to consciously override these reflexes.

You don't need to know this but the way the brain prevents the reflexes is by sending signals through inhibitionary nerves to prevent nerves firing.
