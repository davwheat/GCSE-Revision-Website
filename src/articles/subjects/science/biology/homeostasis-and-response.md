# Homeostasis definition

Definition:

> homeostasis (n.) — maintaining a stable internal environment

## The Necessity of Homeostasis

1. The conditions inside your body need to be kept steady even when the external environment changes
2. Your cells need to work conditions in order to function properly (enzymes need the right environment to function)
3. Homeostasis is the regulation of conditions inside your body and cells to maintain a stable internal environment, in response to changes in environment both internally and externally
4. Your body has many systems to regulate internal environment, including both nervous and hormonal communication systems
5. Automatic control systems components: receptors, coordination centres (including the brain, spinal cord, pancreas) and effectors

## Feedback Loops

Feedback loops are used to ensure that your body maintains a stable internal environment. For example your blood glucose level is controlled via a feedback loop.

Feedback loops are made up of three main components: **receptors**, **coordination centres**, and **effectors**.

### How feedback loops work

If a **receptor** detects that your blood glucose level is too high, it sends a message to your **coordination centre** which organises a response. The **effector** produces a response which counteracts the change and makes the level return to its optimum value.

The opposite reaction happens if your blood glucose level is too low.

The **effectors** continues producing the response as long as they are **stimulated** by the **coordination centre**. Unfortunately, this can cause the opposite problem making the level change too much from the ideal. To combar this, the **receptor detects** if the level changes too much and the **opposite** reaction starts.

This process happens without you thinking about it — it's completely automated. Clever, _huh_?

# The Nervous System

**The Nervous System** allows humans to react to their surroundings and coordinate their behaviour.

## How the Nervous System reacts

1. Living organsisms, like us, need to react to stimuli (changes in their environment) in order to remain living
2. Single-celled organisms can respond to their environment on their own but multicellular organism, like us, need to communicate with each other first
3. Multicellular organisms have evolved to develop nervous and hormonal communication systems

## The Parts of the Nervous System

### Central Nervous System

The **Central Nervous System** (CNS), in vertebrates, consists of the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the CNS is connected to the body via sensory neurons and motor neurons.

### Sensory Neurones

The **neurons** (or **nerves**) that carry information as electrical impulses from the **receptors** to the **CNS**.

### Motor Neurones

The **neurons** (or **nerves**) that carry electrical impulses from the **CNS** to **effector organs**.

### Effector Organs

*All* muscles and glands are **effector organs**. They respond to the impulses from your **motor nerves**.

## Receptors and Effectors can form part of Complex Organs

1. **Receptors** are the cells that **detect stimuli**
2. There are many different types of receptors, such as taste receptors on the tongue and sound receptors in the ears
3. Receptors can form part of **larger, complex organs**, e.g. the retina of the eye is covered in light receptor cells
4. **Effector Organs** respond to nervous impulses and bring about a change
