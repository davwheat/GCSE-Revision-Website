# Homeostasis

Definition:

> homeostasis (n.) — maintaining a stable internal environment

## The Necessity of Homeostasis

1. The conditions inside your body need to be kept steady even when the external environment changes
2. Your cells need to work conditions in order to function properly (enzymes need the right environment to function)
3. Homeostasis is the regulation of conditions inside your body and cells to maintain a stable internal environment, in response to changes in environment both internally and externally
4. Your body has many systems to regulate internal environment, including both nervous and hormonal communication systems
5. Automatic control systems components: receptors, coordination centres (including the brain, spinal cord, pancreas) and effectors

## Feedback Loops

Feedback loops are used to ensure that your body maintains a stable internal environment. For example your blood glucose level is controlled via a feedback loop.

Feedback loops are made up of three main components: **receptors**, **coordination centres**, and **effectors**.

### How feedback loops work

If a **receptor** detects that your blood glucose level is too high, it sends a message to your **coordination centre** which organises a response. The **effector** produces a response which counteracts the change and makes the level return to its optimum value.

The opposite reaction happens if your blood glucose level is too low.

The **effectors** continues producing the response as long as they are **stimulated** by the **coordination centre**. Unfortunately, this can cause the opposite problem making the level change too much from the ideal. To combar this, the **receptor detects** if the level changes too much and the **opposite** reaction starts.

This process happens without you thinking about it — it's completely automated. Clever, _huh_?
