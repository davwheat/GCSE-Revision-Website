There are several different types of electromagnetic wave. They only thing that separates the different types of wave are their **different wavelengths**. All electromagnetic waves are **transverse** and travel at the same speed through a vacuum.

Electromagnetic waves form a continuous spectrum over a range of frequencies. These are:

- Radio waves
- Microwaves
- Infra-red
- Visible light
- Ultraviolet
- X-rays
- Gamma rays

Radio waves have the longest wavelength of up to several kilometres and gamma rays have the shortest wavelength. It's important to know the order of these, but fortunately there is a handy (and mildly obscene) mnemonic:

- **R**andy
- **M**en
- **I**n
- **V**ests
- **U**ndress
- **X**-rated
- **G**rannies

Such a large range of frequencies exist is electromagnetic waves because they are produced by such a wide variety of changes to atoms and their nuclei.

## Song

There's a well-known song that can help you remember the electromagnetic spectrum. If you haven't heard of it, you must be some sort of alien lifeform, so welcome to Earth's internet of connected computers!

# Uses of electromagnetic waves

Read all about it! Read all about it! Electromagnetic waves have tons of different use cases, from communicating around the world, to heating up your dinner, to killing cancer!

## Radio waves

**Radio waves are primarily used for communication.**

**Long wavelength radio waves** can be used to communicate over **long distances** because they **diffract** (bend) around the Earth's surface so do not need a direct line of sight to reach their destination allowing for much longer distances.

**Short wavelength radio waves** cannot diffract but can bounce of the ionosphere which allows them to be transmitted long distances past the curvature of the Earth.

## Microwaves

Microwaves are used to communicate with satellites because the right frequency can pass through the watery atmosphere. For example, when using satellite TV, the transmitter signal is transmitted to the satellite using microwaves. The satellite then transmits the signal in a variety of directions where it is picked up by each individual TV.

Microwave ovens use a different frequency which is absorbed by water (such as in the food which heats it) rather than the satellite frequency which needs to pass through water vapour in the atmosphere.

## Infra-red radiation

Infra-red can be used to monitor temperature. **Every object gives out infra-red radiation**, more radiation means a hotter object. By detecting the amount of radiation, we can monitor the temperature. This is how thermal imaging cameras work.

Infra-red radiation can also be used to **increase the temperature**, such as in cooking or in an electric heater.

## Visible light

Visible light cam be used to **transmit information**. Fibre optic cables are thin glass or plastic cables that transmit data via pulses of light. The light bounces off the walls of the strand, but cannot be easily absorbed, allowing it to easily reach the end of the fibre. This is commonly used in long-distance internet cables, like those under the sea or from your local exchange to that green or grey cabinet at the end of your road.

Visible light is also obviously **used to see** with (more on this later).

## Ultraviolet (UV)

UV can be used in **light bulbs** and **secret ("invisible") ink**. **Fluorescence** is a property of a few special chemicals. This is where **UV light is absorbed and visible light is emitted**, which is the reason why fluorescent objects look so bright (particularly under UV light): they emit light. Secret ink uses a fluorescent chemical and when you shine a UV light on it, visible light is emitted and it can be seen. Fluorescent light bulbs emit UV light which is reflected off a fluorescent substance creating visible light.

Apart from fluorescence, UV light is also used in artificial tanning but **overexposure to UV light can damage cells and cause cancer**.

## X-rays

X-rays, as I'm sure you know, are used in **medicine**. The x-rays are fired at the body and are **absorbed by your bones** and **pass through your skin**, muscle, and flesh. This creates a blank space where there are no x-rays showing the position of bones and if they are broken.

**X-rays can be harmful** to people if they are **overexposed** to the radiation so the radiographers (x-ray specialists) leave the room.

## Gamma rays

Gamma rays are also used in medicine. If there are **cancerous cells** in the body, that area is **exposed to a dose of radiation** to try and **kill** the cancerous cells. Unfortunately, the **gamma rays kill all cells** so the patient may suffer from illness for some time. This is called **radiotherapy**.

Gamma rays can also be used as a tracer inside the body. A radioactive source is taken in a pill or injected and its path can be traced as it travels around the body using a detector. This is because gamma rays can pass through the skin.

More info about this can be found in our radiation articles.
