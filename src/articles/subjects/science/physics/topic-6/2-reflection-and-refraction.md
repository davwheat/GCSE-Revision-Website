When waves arrive at a boundary, they have three options:

- The waves are **absorbed** by the material the wave hits, and the energy is transferred to the materials energy stores.
- The waves are **transmitted** through the material the wave hits (this often leads to refraction).
- The waves are **reflected.**

## Reflection

The rule for all reflection is that: $\text{angle of incidence} = \text{angle of reflection}$.

A reflective surface is shown with the lines behind the boundary and the normal is perpendicular to this. The angle between the incoming ray and the normal is the angle of incidence and the angle between the reflected ray and the normal is the angle of reflection. These are always the same.

We can draw a **ray diagram** to show reflection as shown below.

## Transmission

Transmission occurs when a wave **passes through** another surface instead of being reflected. An example of this could be a window, or water.

Two different things can happen in transmission. If the wave passes through a **boundary** (where a material changes) **perpendicular to the surface** then the wave will **not change direction** but it will **change speed**. For example, if you look directly down through still water, you'll see exactly what's below the surface _but it will often look closer to you_.

This is because if the wave enters a denser material, the **wavelength will decrease**. This would increase the frequency, because more peaks/troughs are passing a point in a certain amount of time. To **counteract** this, **the wave must slow down**, making the wave travel slower through the material. This is why things look closer than they really are when underwater.

### Refraction

The other thing that could happen is **refraction**. When a wave is refracted the **wavelength** changes but the **frequency** doesn't, so the speed has to change.

If the wave is entering a **denser** material, it is refracted **towards** the normal, if it is entering a **less dense** material it is refracted **away** from the normal.

Refraction can also be drawn with a ray diagram. The angle of incidence is the same as in reflection however the **angle of refraction** is either greater than the angle of incidence if the ray enters a denser material, or lower if the ray enters a less dense material.
