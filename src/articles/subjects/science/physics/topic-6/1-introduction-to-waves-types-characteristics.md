Waves are a method of **transferring energy** from one place to another **without moving any matter**. The most obvious example of this is waves in water. In water, the particles move up and down but don't go anywhere. Despite this, energy is transferred along the surface.

# Describing waves

In an exam, you must be able to describe three characteristics of waves, and potentially label these on a diagram. These are the amplitude, wavelength, and frequency, which you can see on the diagram of a transverse wave below. Note that you also have to be able to do the same with a longitudinal wave.

For a longitudinal wave, imagine the wave below but each crest is densely packed particles and each trough is spread apart particles.

## Characteristics

- **Amplitude** : this is the maximum displacement of the wave from its undisturbed position and it shows the energy a wave is carrying (a greater amplitude means more energy).
- **Wavelength** : the distance between the same point on two adjacent waves.
- **Frequency** : this is the number of complete waves that pass a point each second. Frequency is measured in **Hertz** (Hz). Each hertz is **one wave per second**. In the real world this is often too small a value so kHz (1000 Hz) is often used.

### Visualising frequency

Here's three dots that flash at difference frequencies (0.5Hz, 1Hz, and 2Hz).

## Example

Using water ripples as an example, the amplitude is the height of each peak above the normal level, the wavelength is the distance between each peak and frequency is the number of peaks hitting the shore each second.

You could be asked to find the wave speed in metres per second, which is found using the equation: $\text{wave speed}=\frac{\text{wavelength}}{\text{frequency}}$.

You also need to know what the period of a wave is. This is the amount of time (in seconds) it takes for a full wavelength or "cycle" to complete. The equation for this is $\text{period}= \frac{1}{frequency}$.

# Types of waves

There are two basic types of waves you need to know: **transverse** waves and **longitudinal** waves.

It's important to remember that in both types of wave, only the energy is transferred, **no particles move overall**. What this means is that the particles move, but **they always end up moving back to their original positions**.

## Transverse

Transverse waves have oscillations that are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer (they vibrate from side to side). Transverse waves have **peaks** (also knows as crests), **troughs** and a **rest position** (or equilibrium) going through the centre. Examples of transverse waves include water, electromagnetic waves, and waves on a string.

## Longitudinal

Longitudinal waves have oscillations that are in the direction of energy transfer. They have **compressions** and **rarefactions**. Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves and shock waves.
