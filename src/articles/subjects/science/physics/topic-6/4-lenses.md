**Lenses form images by refracting light and changing its direction.** There are two main types of lens: **convex** and **concave**.

# Types of lens

## Convex

Convex lenses look like this:

Convex lenses refract the light **towards a single point**, called the **principal focus** or **focus point** and there is one on each side of the lens. The **focal length** is the distance between the lens and this point.

## Concave

Concave lenses look like this:

They refract light away, **diverging** (spreading) the waves out. If you were to **trace the rays back** towards the light source, the point where they cross is the **principal focus**. Similarly to convex, the **focal length** is the distance between the lens and this point and there is a principal focus on each side of the lens.

Lenses are easy to understand, if you remember the rules for each type.

**Convex:**

- An **incident ray** parallel to the axis passes through the lens and refracts through the **principal focus** on the other side.
- An **incident ray** passing through the **principal focus** refracts through the lens so it travels parallel to the axis on the other side.
- An **incident ray** travelling through the centre of the lens travels through straight to the other side in the same direction.

**Concave:**

- An **incident ray** parallel to the axis passes refracts through the lens and travels in line with the **principal focus** (appearing to have come from that point)
- An **incident ray** passing through the lens towards **principal focus** refracts through the lens so it travels parallel to the axis on the other side.
- An **incident ray** travelling through the centre of the lens travels through straight to the other side in the same direction.

# Real and virtual images

Lenses produce **real** and **virtual** images.

## Real images

A **real image** is where light from an object **converge** (come together) to form an image on a "screen" (like the "screen" on the back of your eye).

## Virtual images

A **virtual image** is where the rays are **diverging** so light appears to have come from a different place. _When you look in a mirror you see a virtual image as you appear to be behind the mirror. A magnifying glass also produces a virtual image; it looks a lot bigger than the object really is._

## Describing images

To describe an image, you must say:

1. How **big** it is compared to the object.
2. Whether it's **upright** or **inverted**.
3. Whether it's **real** or **virtual**.

## (Very) helpful video

Here's a helpful video. It's _not_ from Dr Shaun Robert Donnelly, unlike normal, but still very helpful! I genuinely recommend watching it if you find this section tricky.
