Infrared makes things go red hot! It's just above the colour red on the EM spectrum and is emitted and absorbed by everything.

All objects are constantly **emitting** and **absorbing** infrared radiation. The **hotter** an object is, the **more infrared radiation** is emitted.

If an object is **hotter than its surroundings** it **emits more radiation than it absorbs** which **cools it down** (such as a hot cup of tea). If an object is **colder than its surroundings** it **absorbs more infrared radiation than it emits**, **heating it up** (such as a cold glass of water on a hot day).

Some colours emit and absorb infrared radiation better than others, this is explored with the following required practicals explained below.

# Melting wax

1. Set up the equipment as shown in the diagram below.
2. Stick a pin to two metal plate, using wax or Vaseline.
   - One of the metal plates has a matte black finish, while the other is its native shiny colour.
3. Set up a Bunsen burner between the two plates and begin a stopwatch.
4. Record the time at which each pin falls.

The plate with the matte black finish should heat up faster because **black absorbs infrared radiation more effectively**, causing the wax to melt and the pin to fall off.

# Leslie's cube

A Leslie's cube is a **hollow, watertight metal box** with four different coloured faces (for example: matt black, matt white, shiny metal and dull metal).

1. Place the cube on a heat-proof mat and **fill with boiling water**.
2. Set up an **infrared detector** (or use a thermal imaging camera) a set distance away from each of the faces and measure the amount of IR radiation.
3. You should find the **matte black surface** emits the most radiation.
