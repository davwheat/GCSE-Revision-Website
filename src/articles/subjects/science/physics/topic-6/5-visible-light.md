**Visible light** is made up of a range of colours corresponding to different wavelengths. Different combinations of these colours allow us to see a wider range of colours. **Any colour can be made with a mix of red, green, and blue.** It's not the same as mixing paints. This is why (if you look reeeeeallly closely) you can see that your phone screen, computer screen, TV are all made up of tiny red, green, and blue subpixels.

Remember when light hits an object it can be **absorbed**, **transmitted**, or **reflected**. An object of a certain colour will absorb every wavelength of light **except** that colour. If an object is white it reflects all colours and if it is black it absorbs all colours.

For example, if an object is red, all the colours are absorbed by the object except red, meaning that red is reflected off of the object into our eyes, making it appear red.

If an object is **transparent** (or **translucent**) the light can pass through and **isn't reflected** into our eyes, like a glass window.

## Filters

Filters only let specific wavelengths (and therefore colours) through. Any other wavelength is absorbed.

If you looked at a **red object** through a **red filter** it would look **normal**. This is because the red light that is reflected off of the object can pass through the filter.

If a **red object** is seen through a **blue filter** it appears **black**. This is because only red light is reflected off the object, but this is then absorbed by the filter. Remember, if no light or colour reaches our eyes, then the object appears black.
