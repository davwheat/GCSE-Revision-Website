Sound waves are created b.y vibrating objects, such as vocal cords when we speak. These vibrations are transmitted as a longitudinal wave. Waves with **high amplitude are loud**, and waves with **low amplitude are quiet**. Similarly, a wave with a **higher frequency** correlate to a **higher pitched sound**.

Sound generally travels faster through solids than liquids, and faster through liquids than gases. When a sound wave travels through a solid, it does so by making the particles **vibrate**. Sound can't travel through space because it is a vacuum so there are no particles to vibrate. Sound waves can also be **reflected** (echoes) and **refracted**.

# How we hear

Sound waves that hit your **eardrum** cause it to vibrate. These vibrations are passed through tiny bones called **ossicles** , through the **semi-circular canals** and to the **cochlea**. The cochlea turns this into an **electrical signal** which gets sent to your brain. You should already know this as it plays a bigger role in GCSE Biology.

Human hearing is limited by the size and shape of the eardrum as well as the parts inside. Most humans can hear within the range of around **20Hz to 20kHz**.

# Ultrasound waves

**Ultrasound** is sound waves with frequencies higher than the human hearing range (over around 20kHz). Electrical devices can easily create frequencies this high (unlike humans). When a wave passes from one medium to another, some of the wave is **reflected** off the boundary and some is **transmitted** (and refracted). This is called **partial reflection**. This means wherever there are boundaries, some sound is reflected. The time it takes for the sound to reflect to a detector can be used to measure the distance to the boundary.

## Uses

### Medicine

Ultrasound is used to check the **foetus during pregnancy**. Ultrasound can **pass through the body** but some of the wave is reflected at each boundary between two media. The exact timing and distribution of the echoes are used to produce a **video image** of the foetus. We aren't sure if ultrasound is completely safe yet, but it is still much safer than using x-rays.

### Industry

Ultrasound can be used to find **cracks** and **flaws** in pipes or materials such as wood or metal. Ultrasound will usually be reflected by the far side of the material unless there is a flaw in between. In this case, the wave will be reflected and detected earlier.

### Exploration

Echolocation uses **high frequency sound waves** such as ultrasound to find the **depth of water or objects in deep water**.
