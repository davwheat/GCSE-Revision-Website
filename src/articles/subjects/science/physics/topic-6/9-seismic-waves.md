Not all **seismic waves** are the same. Some travel along the surface of the Earth (**surface waves**), and some travel through the Earth (**body waves**). You need to know about **body waves**.

When there is an earthquake, seismic waves travel throughout the Earth. These can be read using **seismometers**. **Seismologists** measure the time it takes for waves to reach each seismometer and where the wave doesn't reach. Seismic waves are **reflected** and **refracted** when they reach a boundary like all other waves. Although there are sometimes sharp changes in direction, most waves are being **constantly refracted** creating a **curved** path.

We can use seismic waves to provide evidence for the internal structure of the Earth. The Earth has a **crust**, **mantle**, **outer core**, and **inner core** and seismic waves behave differently in each of these.

Not all seismic waves are the same. There are **P-wave** s and **S-waves** which also behave differently:

# P-waves

P-waves **longitudinal**. They **can travel through liquids or gases** meaning they **can get through Earth's liquid outer core**. However, they are refracted differently than throughout the rest of the Earth creating a "**shadow zone**" where **no waves reach**. They are also **faster** than S-waves (about 8 km per second).

# S-waves

S-waves are **transverse.** They **can't travel through liquids or gases** meaning they **can't get through Earth's liquid outer core**. This creates a "shadow zone" on the underside of the Earth where no waves reach. They are also **slower** than P-waves (about 3.45 km per second).
