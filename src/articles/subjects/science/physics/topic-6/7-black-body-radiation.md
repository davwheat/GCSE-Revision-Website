A **perfect black body** is an object that absorbs **all** the radiation that hits it. **No** radiation is **reflected** or **transmitted**. As good absorbers are also good emitters, perfect black bodies are also the best possible emitters of radiation. This radiation isn't just infrared, it covers a range of wavelengths and frequencies from the spectrum.

As you should know, all objects absorb and transmit infrared radiation but as the temperature increases, the amount of IR radiation or the **intensity** increases too. However, the wavelength also shortens as temperature increases, into the visible light range. This is the reason why very hot objects such as metals glow red, then yellow, then white. They glow red first as this is the longest wavelength in visible light and the closest to infrared. Remember, as **temperature increases** , the **intensity increases** and the **wavelength becomes shorter**.

In the graph above, you can see that the intensity of the "very hot object" is highest in the blue spectrum of visible light, showing that a very hot object will be blue in colour (like a Bunsen's roaring flame). Likewise, the "hot object" has a peak in yellow, and the "warm object" has a peak in the red area. This is known as the **principal wavelength**.

# The Earth

The **Earth absorbs and emits energy**. This energy (such as **visible light** and **ultraviolet**) is radiated from the Sun. Some of this energy is reflected before it reaches the ground, for example by clouds. Any remaining energy can be absorbed by the Earth's surface, increasing the Earth's temperature, causing it to **emit infrared radiation**. However, due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, more and more of this emitted infrared is trapped and reflected back to the Earth's surface.

The Earth's temperature varies as the day passes. When we face towards the sun, more energy is absorbed than is emitted, heating up the Earth. During the night, when we face away from the sun, more energy is emitted than absorbed (as we aren't absorbing the sun's energy), making the Earth lose heat.
