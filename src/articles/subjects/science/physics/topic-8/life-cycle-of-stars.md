Stars are kinda like pubescent children: they keep changing and never make their mind up...

# Stages of life

There are loads of stages that stars go through in their lifetime, as well as different possible pathways. It's easier to understand from a diagram.

## Cloud of dust

Every star begins like this: a cloud of particles floating around the universe, called a **nebula**. Slowly, the force of **gravity** pulls together the particles, creating a **protostar**.

## Protostar

As the star becomes denser, its **temperature rises** and more particles start **colliding**. When the temperature gets really high, the hydrogen nuclei begin performing **nuclear fusion** (merging together) to form **helium**, releasing huge amounts of energy.

## Main sequence star

The star enters a **long, stable period** where nothing much happens. The **outward pressure** caused by the nuclear fusion is **balanced** by the force of **gravity**. It tends to stay like this for a **few billion years**. Our Sun is in the middle of this period.

## Red giants & red super giants

Depending on the **size** of the star, it will then become a red giant or a red super giant. If the star is about the same size (or less) than our Sun, it becomes a **red giant**. Otherwise, it swells into a **red super giant**. It goes **red** because the **surface** of the star **cools**. This all happens because the star runs out of hydrogen atoms, causing it to start performing **fusion on larger and larger atoms** (all the way up to **iron**) and the **pressure in the core increases rapidly**.

## White dwarf

A red giant will become **unstable** and **eject** its **outer layer of dust and gas**. This will leave behind a hot, dense, solid core: a **white dwarf**.

## Black dwarf

As a white dwarf cools down, it emits less and less **energy**. When it no longer emits a significant amount, it is called a **black dwarf**.

## Supernova

A red super giant, however, starts to glow brightly again as they **undergo nuclear fusion** and **expand and contract several times**. The **fusion** creates larger and **larger atoms**, **heavier than iron**, and **ejects** them into the universe, creating **new planets and stars**. Stars and their life cycle produce and distribute all naturally occurring elements.

## Neutron star or black hole

The **exploding supernova** throws the outer layers of **dust and gas** into space, leaving a **very dense core** called a **neutron star**.

If the star is **big enough**, it will become a **black hole**: a super dense point in space that not even light can escape from.
