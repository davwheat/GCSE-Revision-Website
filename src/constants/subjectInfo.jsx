  English: `We offer many helpful English revision
  tools, such as: mini language mocks, essay planning
  tips, quote memorising tools, and literature knowledge
  organisers. We're always looking to add more to the
  site!`,
  "English Language": `English Language often gets labelled as 
  stressful, horrible and downright useless. And to be honest, 
  that's pretty accurate. GCSE Revise It! can help you manage 
  this with top tips for each paper as well as many other useful 
  strategies.`,
  Maths: `Our site provides useful tips and tricks to
  help you make the most of your calculator as well as maths
  quizzes and articles on harder topics.`,
  "Computer Science": `Computer Science is made easier with
  our site. With useful suggestions for converting between hex,
  decimal and binary as well as an interactive bitmap editor,
  there's nothing else you'll need to revise (...except your
  brain and an internet-enabled device).`,
  Science: `We offer both Triple and Combined Science reference
  articles for every topic in the book!`,
  Biology: `We offer both Triple and Combined Science reference
  articles for every topic in the book!`,
